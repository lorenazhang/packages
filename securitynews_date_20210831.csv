Advanced pathfinding (Dijkstra) to find the most efficient paths

Support for exploitation with NTLM hashes (pass-the-hash)

Saves restore state, easy rollback of changes

Can be run via a SOCKS tunnel

Written in Python (2.7 and 3.5+), so OS independent

Installation of Aclpwn.py ACL Based Privilege Escalation

Aclpwn.py is compatible with both Python 2.7 and 3.5+. It requires the neo4j-driver , impacket and ldap3 libraries. You can install aclpwn.py via pip: pip install aclpwn . For Python 3, you will need the python36 branch of impacket since the master branch (and versions published on PyPI) are Python 2 only at this point.

This tool does not exploit any vulnerabilities, but relies on misconfigured (often because of delegated privileges) or insecure default ACLs. To solve these issues, it is important to identify potentially dangerous ACLs in your Active Directory environment with BloodHound. For detection, Windows Event Logs can be used.

gitlab-watchman --timeframe a --all 1 gitlab - watchman -- timeframe a -- all

Or arguments can be grouped together to search more granularly. This will look for commits and milestones for the last 30 days, and output the results to a TCP stream:

gitlab-watchman --timeframe m --commits --milestones --output stream 1 gitlab - watchman -- timeframe m -- commits -- milestones -- output stream

Logging in GitLab Watchman to Audit Gitlab For Sensitive Data

GitLab Watchman gives the following logging options:

Log file

Stdout

TCP stream

Results are output in JSON format, perfect for ingesting into a SIEM or other log analysis platform.

For file and TCP stream logging, configuration options need to be passed via .conf file or environment variable. See the file docs/logging.md for instructions on how to set it up.

If no logging option is given, GitLab Watchman defaults to Stdout logging.

Researchers at cybersecurity firm Rapid7 discovered two vulnerabilities that can be exploited by hackers to remotely disarm the Fortress S03 WiFi Security System manufactured by Fortress Security Store.

The Fortress S03 Wi-Fi Home Security System allows users to build their own alarm system to secure their homes and small businesses. It supports security cameras, window and door sensors, glass break sensors, vibration and motion sensors, and smoke/gas/water alarms.

The company provides its systems to thousands of clients and continued customers.

The flaws, tracked as CVE-2021-39276 (CVSS score: 5.3) and CVE-2021-39277 (CVSS score: 5.7), can be abused by a threat actor to gain unauthorized access to the system.

Both issues were reported by cybersecurity firm Rapid7 in May 2021.

“Rapid7 researcher Arvind Vishwakarma discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the Fortress S03 WiFi Home Security System. These vulnerabilities could result in unauthorized access to control or modify system behavior, and access to unencrypted information in storage or in transit.” reads the post published by Rapid7.

The CVE-2021-39276 flaw is an insecure cloud API deployment, while the CVE-2021-39277 issue can allow anyone within Radio Frequency (RF) signal range to capture and replay RF signals to alter systems behavior.

“CVE-2021-39276 describes an instance of CWE-287; specifically, it describes an insecure cloud API deployment which allows unauthenticated users to trivially learn a secret that can then be used to alter the system’s functionality remotely.” continues the post. “It has an initial CVSS score of 5.3 (medium). CVE-2021-39277 describes an instance of CWE-294, a vulnerability where anyone within Radio Frequency (RF) signal range could capture and replay RF signals to alter systems behavior, and has an initial CVSS score of 5.7.”

An attacker could exploit the CVE-2021-39276 by knowing the targeted user’s email address and use it to query the API and obtain the IMEI number associated with the security system. Once the attacker has obtained the IMEI, he can send unauthenticated POST requests to change the behavior the system, including disarming it.

The CVE-2021-39277 flaw can be exploited to launch a radio frequency (RF) signal replay attack because communications between different components of the home security system are not properly protected.

An attacker in the radio range of the target can capture command-and-control signals over the air, such as a command to disarm the system, and then replay them at a later time.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) is warning of a high-severity privilege escalation vulnerability in Sudo open-source program used within its Aruba AirWave management platform. The Aruba AirWave management platform is a real-time monitoring and security alert platform designed by HPE.

An unprivileged and unauthenticated local attacker could exploit the vulnerability to gain root privileges on a vulnerable host.

“A vulnerability in the command line parameter parsing code of sudo could allow an attacker with access to sudo to execute commands or binaries with root privileges. The main impact of this vulnerability would be as part of a “chained attack” where an attacker has achieved a foothold with lower privileges via another vulnerability and then uses this to escalate privileges.” reads the security advisory.

Experts warn that this flaw could be chained with other vulnerabilities by an attacker with lower privileges to escalate them once obtained access to the target system.

The CVE-2021-3156 was discovered by Qualys researchers in January, it has allowed any local user to gain root privileges on Unix-like operating systems without authentication.

Sudo is one of the most important, powerful, and commonly used utilities that comes as a core command pre-installed on macOS and almost every UNIX or Linux-based operating system.

sudo is a program for Unix-like computer operating systems that allows users to run programs with the security privileges of another user, by default the superuser. It originally stood for “superuser do” as the older versions of sudo were designed to run commands only as the superuser.

The Sudo CVE-2021-3156 vulnerability, dubbed Baron Samedit, is a heap-based buffer overflow that was reported on January 13th and disclosed at the end of January to give the development team the time to address the issue.

HPE confirmed that the flaw affected the AirWave management platform prior to version 8.2.13.0 that was released on June 18, 2021.

HPE also provided a workaround for HPE AirWave customers and pointed out that Aruba is not aware of any attacks in the wild against Aruba products exploiting the above vulnerability.

“To minimize the likelihood of an attacker exploiting these vulnerabilities, Aruba recommends that the CLI and web-based management interfaces for AirWave be restricted to a dedicated layer 2 segment/VLAN and/or controlled by firewall policies at layer 3 and above.” concludes the advisory.

Technical details of a serious vulnerability in the Microsoft Exchange Server, dubbed ProxyToken (CVE-2021-33766), were publicly disclosed. The issue could be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker to access emails from a target account.

An attacker can trigger the flaw by sending a specially crafted request to web services within the Exchange Control Panel (ECP) application and access messages from a victim’s inbox.

An attacker could exploit the issue to access mailbox settings and set up an email forwarding rule in order to receive the messages sent to the victims.

As a pre-requisite for the attack, the attacker needs to have an account on the same Exchange server as the victim.

“This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Microsoft Exchange Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.” reads the advisory published Zero-Day Initiative (ZDI). “The specific flaw exists within the authentication of requests to web services within the ecp web application. By issuing a crafted request, an attacker can bypass authentication. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose information from the server.”

The vulnerability was discovered by Le Xuan Tuyen from the Information Security Center of Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Group (VNPT-ISC) in March.

The experts noticed that Outlook Web Access and Exchange Control Panel pass authentication requests to the Exchange Back End.

When the “Delegated Authentication” feature is active in Microsoft Exchange installs, the front-end forwards the requests that need authentication to the backend. These requests include a ‘SecurityToken’ cookie that when is present in a request within ‘/ecp’, delegates the authentication process to the backend.

“Thus, for requests within /ecp, if the front end finds a non-empty cookie named SecurityToken, it delegates authentication to the back end. Code on the back end that examines and validates the SecurityToken cookie is found in the class Microsoft.Exchange.Configuration.DelegatedAuthentication.DelegatedAuthenticationModule” reads the analysis published by ZDI. “As you can see, in a default configuration of the product, a element appears, so that the module DelegatedAuthModule will not be loaded at all for the back-end ECP site.”

Anyway, the experts noticed that in a default configuration of the product, the module DelegatedAuthModule will not be loaded at all for the back-end ECP site.

“In summary, when the front end sees the SecurityToken cookie, it knows that the back end alone is responsible for authenticating this request. Meanwhile, the back end is completely unaware that it needs to authenticate some incoming requests based upon the SecurityToken cookie, since the DelegatedAuthModule is not loaded in installations that have not been configured to use the special delegated authentication feature. The net result is that requests can sail through, without being subjected to authentication on either the front or back end.” continues the analysis.

Experts noticed that in order to trigger the issue, each request to an /ecp page is required to have a ticket known as the “ECP canary”. In the absence of the canary, the request will come back with an HTTP 500. However, the researchers noticed that the 500 error response is accompanied by a valid canary that could be used to issue an unauthenticated request.

Microsoft has addressed the ProxyToken flaw in July, it has been rated with a CVSS score of 7.5 because it could be exploited by an attacker with an account on the same Exchange server as the victim.

Researchers from Bleeping Computer noticed that some experts already reported exploit attempts that occurred in the last weeks.

Below is a tweet published by security experts Rich Warren from NCC Groug:

The US DoJ announced a new Cyber Fellowship program for training selected prosecutors and attorneys on cyber threat and threat actors.

The course is coordinated through the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section.

The training aims at personnel from various departments which are focused on cyber defense, such as the Criminal Division or the U.S. Attorneys’ Offices.

The training will provide details about cybersecurity-related cases such as operations of state-sponsored threat actors and cybercrime organizations and related TTPs.

“Today, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco announced the creation of a new Cyber Fellowship program, designed to develop a new generation of prosecutors and attorneys equipped to handle emerging national security threats.” reads the announcement published by DoJ. “Fellows can expect to investigate and prosecute state-sponsored cyber threats; transnational criminal groups; infrastructure and ransomware attacks; and the use of cryptocurrency and money laundering to finance and profit from cyber-based crimes.”

The program will require all trainees to secure a Top Secret security clearance and commit for the entire duration of the program (three years). The training will be held in the Washington, D.C. area.

“As we have witnessed this past year, cyber threats pose a significant and increasing risk to our national security, our economic security, and our personal security,” said Deputy Attorney General Monaco. “We need to develop the next generation of prosecutors with the training and experience necessary to combat the next generation of cyber threats. This Fellowship gives attorneys a unique opportunity to gain the well-rounded experience they need to tackle the full range of those threats.”

The DoJ also states the trainees may be extended or converted to permanent positions without further competition. The participants may also reapply to the Honors Program in a subsequent year or may apply for permanent positions within the department.

The deadline for prosecutors and attorneys to take part in the Cyber Fellowship program is September 8.

Personnel interested into the program could apply it through the Justice Department’s Honors Program application portal. Applicants to this year’s Honors Program should indicate if they would like to be considered for the Cyber Fellowship.

The 25 days long DDoS attack against the website of Karapatan was launched by almost 30.000 IP addresses, whereas one third of the addresses originated from devices that there were not running “Open Proxies” or “Tor exits”. Identifying this mysterious part of the botnet turned to be a fascinating research and a digital forensics challenge. The traces lead us to an Israeli firm offering access to millions of proxies in mobile operators, data centers and residential buildings – a perfect infrastructure to hide the source of DDoS attacks.

This is Part II of our ongoing research on the DDoS attack against Karapatan. For background information, please read the report “Human rights alliance ‘Karapatan’ under long lasting DDoS attack“.

Finding patterns – identifying clusters

Once we were able to flag the addresses associated with the Tor network and those that came from publicly visible proxy services, we classified the 8,000 “unknown” IP addresses in pools based on country, operator, time and attack cluster. We defined an “attack cluster” as the group of IP addresses that flooded the website within one hour period with similar requests.

A few patterns showed quickly, the first one was that most of the addresses came from a number of mobile providers in Russia and Ukraine, such as MTS, MegaFon, T2 Mobile, PVimpelCom and Kyivstar.

We also noticed that the IPs were rotating every hour, and blocks of 50 new IPs were launching the same query attack at the same time.

During an attack of this nature, it is difficult to find clear patterns without fast data and log processing and ad-hoc tools but our DNS servers were clearly recording these spikes of DNS updates every time the botnet was renewing IP addresses. We love patterns and here we found a clear one!

The first finding was that the attackers kept using their “CC-Attack modified python script” generating GET and POST floods to the /resources section of karapatan.org but instead of using open proxies and the Tor network, they were proxing the attack traffic via a “private proxy network” geo-located in a few countries.

Unexpected name resolution requests

What was strange, was that while the attack was coming from Russia and Ukraine, many of these periodical DNS resolutions were instead coming from very different providers, in specific AS20473 Choopa and AS62567 Digital Ocean. So whatever that was flooding us was resolving the domain karapatan.org from inside of these providers.

Waves of attacks strongly geo-located using very few providers

By the second week of August 2021, we knew that the private proxy network inside of the Mobile Operators in Russia and Ukraine was speeding up their connections by making the name resolution of the targeted domain elsewhere.

Luminati Proxies as a DDoS botnet

A review of hundreds of servers in these DNS infrastructures revealed hundreds of proxies with the banner:

< HTTP/1.1 407 Proxy Authentication Required < X-Luminati-Error: Proxy Authentication Required < Proxy-Authenticate: Basic realm=""Luminati"" < Date: Sat, 21 Aug 2021 10:49:31 GMT < Connection: keep-alive < Keep-Alive: timeout=5 < Transfer-Encoding: chunked

Who is Bright Data (Luminati Networks)?

Bright Data (formerly Luminati) with headquarters in Netanya, Israel, offers access to millions of proxies in mobile operators, data centers and residential buildings and promises to “unlock any website & collect accurate data to make data-driven business decisions”. Their business practices have long been criticized for their use of mobile VPNs and other “backdoored” Mobile Apps to gain access to residential and mobile devices.

“Never get blocked” sales presentation from Bright Data/Luminati

Once we discovered how this “super proxies” infrastructures looked like, we could search for them in Censys and later on discover the locations of thousands of them by looking into their associated domains: lum-superproxy.io and l-cdn.com

We knew that the super-proxies had ports 7547, 5000-44818 open. A simple query to Censys using the 16993.https.get.headers.proxy_authenticate=Luminati or “X-Luminati-Error” in Shodan was enough to find the main locations of the super-proxies.

Luminati documentation was also enlightening as it was consistent with the DNS resolution anomaly.

Attacker connected to Luminati’s installed Proxy Manager from CC-Attack to flood Karapatan.org

Expert documentation from Luminati explaining the “resolve DNS at super proxy” feature

Thousands of rotating IPs flooding the website

The traffic patterns we recorded were consistent with new pools of IPs rotating every hour. At the beginning of our research, we speculated that this behavior could be the result of a “pay as you go” stress testing service that allowed a maximum of one hour attack time. After several days monitoring the website we could determine that the traffic patterns were the result of Luminati automatically rotating their residential and mobile proxies in an hour basis.

During weeks, Luminati was flooding the website with no less than 100 new IPs ever hour and thousands of requests per second.

Number of Luminati IPs detected per hour in the last ten days of the attack

How much does the attack traffic cost?

Not surprisingly, this was the first time Qurium saw this infrastructure used for Denial of Service attacks as the Luminati traffic is far from cheap. One GB of traffic ranges between 26-35 USD for Mobile Proxies and 10-15 USD for Residential Proxies.

Only during the ten day period 10th-20th August 2021, we estimated close to 10 TB (10.000 GB) of attack traffic coming from Luminati. Using the “Plus” Package of Luminati, the attack sums up to the crazy figure of 260,000 USD for that 10-day period only.

It is difficult to believe that an attacker launching billions of requests flooding one single website has been undetected by Luminati for weeks. Only “Bright Data / Luminati Networks” will be able to bring light to this case and explain to the general public how this “business deal” was arranged.

Bright Data response to the abuse report

The 21st of August 2021, an abuse report was sent to Bright Data (Luminati Networks) about the attack. A sample of the traffic logs of the floods was shared with the company, the traffic logs included 1556 IP addresses from 68 networks of MTS and Megafon.

Some of the prefixes we shared contain more than 50 IPs engaged in the floodings.

After some email exchanges, where Bright Data did not request more evidence, we received this fascinating explanation on August 24th.

“The IPs from the list you have attached (attaching it again) belong to Bright Data, however we did not find any of them in the requests that were sent to the reported domain. Due to the lack of findings, we keep the reported domain blocked for all of our customers, and from all of our networks, therefore we expect no requests will be sent to it through our network. Thank you for your report and hope we managed to help you sufficiently”.

As in other cases when we have traced back attack infrastructure, the email exchange finish with the common “No worries. We did not do it. It will not happen again”:

(…) we left the domain blocked so no traffic to karapatan.org will be going through our network. That way we can ensure you that no future abuse could be generated from our networks.

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued an alert urging organizations to address the recently disclosed vulnerability in Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB (aka ChaosDB) as soon as possible.

Last week, researchers from Cloud security company Wiz disclosed technical details of a now-fixed Azure Cosmos database vulnerability, dubbed ChaosDB, that could have been potentially exploited by attackers to gain full admin access to other customers’ database instances without any authorization. The flaw was trivial to exploit and impacts thousands of organizations worldwide.

“#ChaosDB is an unprecedented critical vulnerability in the Azure cloud platform that allows for remote account takeover of Azure’s flagship database – Cosmos DB. The vulnerability, which was disclosed to Microsoft in August 2021 by Wiz Research Team, gives any Azure user full admin access (read, write, delete) to another customers Cosmos DB instances without authorization.” reads the post published by the security firm,

Azure Cosmos Darabase is Microsoft’s globally-distributed multi-model database service.

Wiz experts identified an exploit that leverages a chain of vulnerabilities in the Jupyter Notebook feature of Cosmos DB that enables an attacker to obtain the credentials corresponding to the target Cosmos DB account, including the Primary Key. These credentials allow users to view, modify, and delete data in the target Cosmos DB account via multiple channels.

Microsoft acknowledged the issue and said that it is not aware of attacks exploiting the vulnerability to access customer data.

“This vulnerability only affects a subset of customers who had the Jupyter Notebook feature enabled. Notifications have been sent to all customers that could be potentially affected due to researcher activity, advising they regenerate their primary read-write key. Other keys including the secondary read-write key, primary read-only key, and secondary read-only key were not vulnerable.” reads the post published by Microsoft which also includes instructions on how to regenerate the user’s primary read-write key. If you did not receive an email or in-portal notification, there is no evidence any other external parties had access to your primary read-write account key. If you have diagnostic logs enabled, you can also review the logs for unusual IP addresses. Our suggestion is to enable Diagnostic Logging and Azure Defender where available and periodically rotate your keys.”

Now CISA urges Azure Cosmos DB customers to regenerate their certificate keys and to review Microsoft’s guidance on how to Secure access to data in

“CISA is aware of a misconfiguration vulnerability in Microsoft’s Azure Cosmos DB that may have exposed customer data. Although the misconfiguration appears to have been fixed within the Azure cloud, CISA strongly encourages Azure Cosmos DB customers to roll and regenerate their certificate keys and to review Microsoft’s guidance on how to Secure access to data in Azure Cosmos DB.” reads the advisory published by CISA.

Researchers from Malwarebytes Labs spotted an ongoing malware campaign that is targeing Russia with the Konni RAT.

Security researchers at Malwarebytes Labs have uncovered an ongoing malware campaign that is mainly targeting Russia with the Konni RAT.

The KONNI RAT was first spotted by Cisco Talos researchers in 2017, it has been undetected since 2014 and was employed in highly targeted attacks. The RAT was able to avoid detection due to continuous evolution, it is able of executing arbitrary code on the target systems and stealing data.

The Konni RAT has been attributed to North Korea-linked threat actors tracked as Thallium and APT37.

Malwarebytes experts discovered two weaponized documents written in the Russian language, one using the trade and economic issues between Russia and the Korean Peninsula as a lure. The second document used a meeting of the intergovernmental Russian-Mongolian commission as a lure.

Upon enabling macro it executes the infection chain will start deploying a new variant of Konni RAT that is heavily obfuscated.

“These malicious documents used by Konni APT have been weaponized with the same simple but clever macro. It just uses a Shell function to execute a one-liner cmd command. This one liner command gets the current active document as input and looks for the “^var” string using findstr and then writes the content of the line staring from “var” into y.js. At the end it calls Wscript Shell function to executes the Java Script file (y.js).” reads the analysis published by Malwarebytes. “The clever part is that the actor tried to hide its malicious JS which is the start of its main activities at the end of the document content and did not put it directly into the macro to avoid being detected by AV products as well as hiding its main intent from them.”

Malware researchers noticed multiple differences between this campaign and previous ones orchestrated by the North Korea-linked APT group, including:

The macros are different. In the old campaign the actor used TextBoxes to store its data while in the new one the content has been base64 encoded within the document content.

In the new campaign JavaScript files have been used to execute batch and PowerShell files.

The new campaign uses Powershell and URLMON API calls to download the cab file while in the old campaign it used certutil to download the cab file.

The new campaign has used two different UAC bypass techniques based on the victim’s OS while in the old one the actor only used the Token Impersonation technique.

In the new campaign the actor has developed a new variant of Konni RAT that is heavily obfuscated. Also, its configuration is encrypted and is not base64 encoded anymore. It also does not use FTP for exfiltration.

Experts observed infections also in other countries, including Japan, Nepal, Mongolia, and Vietnam.

Additional details, including Indicators of Compromise (IoC), are reported in the analysis published by Malwarebytes.

A pair of security vulnerabilities in the WooCommerce Dynamic Pricing and Discounts plugin from Envato could allow unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious code into websites running unpatched versions.
The plugin, which has 19,700+ sales on Envato Market, offers a variety of pricing and promotion tools for online retailers, including special offers, bulk pricing, tiered pricing, bundle pricing, deals of the day, flash sales, wholesale pricing, member pricing, individual pricing, loyalty programs, behavioral pricing, location-based pricing and so on.
“An unauthenticated user can import the plugin’s settings.
“An unauthenticated user can export the plugin’s settings, inject JavaSript code into the JSON file and reimport it using the previous vulnerability,” according to NinTechNet.","The popular Dynamic Pricing and Discounts plugin from Envato can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers.

A pair of security vulnerabilities in the WooCommerce Dynamic Pricing and Discounts plugin from Envato could allow unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious code into websites running unpatched versions. This can result in a variety of attacks, including website redirections to phishing pages, insertion of malicious scripts on product pages and more.

The plugin, which has 19,700+ sales on Envato Market, offers a variety of pricing and promotion tools for online retailers, including special offers, bulk pricing, tiered pricing, bundle pricing, deals of the day, flash sales, wholesale pricing, member pricing, individual pricing, loyalty programs, behavioral pricing, location-based pricing and so on. It also supports conditional price increase and extra fees.



According to researchers at the Ninja Technologies Network, the two unauthenticated vulnerabilities affect version 2.4.1 and below. The first is a high-severity stored cross-site scripting (XSS) bug; the second is a medium-severity settings export problem.

The XSS bug exists in the __construct method of the “wc-dynamic-pricing-and-discounts/classes/rp-wcdpd-settings.class.php” script, according to a Tuesday writeup from NinTechNet.

“It lacks a capability check and a security nonce and thus is accessible to everyone, authenticated or not,” researchers explained. “An unauthenticated user can import the plugin’s settings. Because some fields aren’t sanitized, the attacker can inject JavaScript code into the imported JSON-encoded file.”

If successful, the code will be executed on every product page of the WooCommerce e-shop, they added. Additionally, attackers could replace JavaScript code with any HTML tags, such as a Meta Refresh tag, which could be used to redirect visitors and customers to a malicious website.

Also, the import function lacks a security nonce to prevent against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks, where a user can submit unauthorized commands from a site that the web application trusts.

The second bug exists because a core export function lacks a capability check and is accessible to everyone, authenticated or not.

“An unauthenticated user can export the plugin’s settings, inject JavaSript code into the JSON file and reimport it using the previous vulnerability,” according to NinTechNet.

The issues are patched in version 2.4.2, though the CSRF check is still not fixed, researchers warned.

Users of WooCommerce, the popular e-commerce platform for WordPress, are no strangers to having to patch security problems, and it’s important to keep on top of patching. Last month for instance WooCommerce rushed emergency fixes for a critical SQL-injection security vulnerability in the core platform and a related plugin that had been under attack as a zero-day bug, for instance. The bug could allow unauthenticated cyberattackers to make off with scads of information from an online store’s database – anything from customer data and payment-card info to employee credentials.

On Monday, QNAP put out two security advisories about OpenSSL remote-code execution and denial-of-service (DoS) bugs, fixed last week, that affect its network-attached storage (NAS) devices.

The vulnerabilities are tracked as CVE-2021-3711 – a high-severity buffer overflow related to SM2 decryption– and CVE-2021-3712, a medium-severity flaw that can be exploited for DoS attacks and possibly for the disclosure of private memory contents.

These OpenSSL flaws are spreading ripples far and wide.



That’s because OpenSSL is mostly used by network software – including being widely used by Internet servers and the majority of HTTPS websites – that use the TLS protocol (transport layer security), formerly known as SSL (secure sockets layer), to protect data in transit.

TLS has replaced SSL, which contained what Sophos’s Paul Ducklin called a “huge” number of cryptographic flaws. But many popular open-source programming libraries that support it – including OpenSSL, LibreSSL and BoringSSL, “have kept old-school product names for the sake of familiarity,” Ducklin commented in a recent drilldown into the OpenSSL bugs.

QNAP on Monday joined a parade of organizations whose products rely on OpenSSL and which are either investigating the flaws (in QNAP’s case) or have already released security advisories, including Linux distributions such as Red Hat (not affected), Ubuntu, SUSE, Debian and Alpine Linux.

QNAP Hammers Out Fixes

QNAP said that it’s “thoroughly investigating the case” and that it plans to release security updates and more information ASAP.

Same goes for NAS appliance maker Synology, which told its customers that the OpenSSL vulnerabilities affect its Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM), Synology Router Manager (SRM), VPN Plus Server and VPN Server products. On Thursday, Synology assigned “important” and “moderate” severity ratings to the vulnerabilities and said that it’s working on patches.

Yet another storage solutions provider, NetApp, is now trying to figure out which of its products may be affected. So far, it’s confirmed that Clustered Data ONTAP, E-Series SANtricity OS controller software, the NetApp Manageability SDK, NetApp SANtricity SMI-S Provider, and NetApp Storage Encryption are affected, and it’s investigating dozens more of its products.

Cisco and Broadcom are also expected to release advisories describing how the latest OpenSSL vulnerabilities will affect their products.

QNAP’s Advisories

It turns out that the OpenSSL vulnerabilities affect QNAP NAS devices running the HBS 3 Hybrid Backup Sync data backup and disaster recovery tool, the QTS GUI, the QuTS hero operating system, and QuTScloud, which is an operating system for QNAP Cloud NAS virtual appliances.

According to Sophos’s Ducklin, the flaws could allow an attacker to trick an application “into thinking that something succeeded (or failed) when it didn’t, or even to take over the flow of program execution entirely.

If successfully exploited, the flaws could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the application, QNAP said, which gives CVE-2021-3711 a high severity rating. CVE-2021-3712 allows remote attackers to disclose memory data or execute a DoS attack, making it a medium-security flaw.

MITRE has the technical details here for CVE-2021-3712 and CVE-2021-3711.

CVE-2021-3711 is a heap-based buffer overflow. These bugs generally lead to crashes but can also translate into lack of availability, including putting the program into an infinite loop. Such vulnerabilities can also allow attackers to carry out RCE, bypass protection, or to modify memory.

According to MITRE, the CVE-2021-3711 bug in OpenSSL allows an attacker who can present SM2 content – SM2 being a public key cryptographic algorithm based on elliptic curves that’s used to generate and verify digital signatures for decryption – to send data that overflows the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes, “altering the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application to crash.”

As Sophos’s Ducklin explained when writing about this decryption bug, OpenSSL includes implementations of the SM algorithms: It uses SM2 for key agreement and digital signatures, SM3 for hashing, and SM4 for block encryption. On the plus side, Sophos researchers don’t think that crooks are going to be able to exploit this bug, given that “official TLS support for ShangMi was only introduced in RFC 8998, dated March 2021, so it’s a newcomer to the world’s cryptographic stable.”

As Ducklin wrote, OpenSSL does include implementations of SM2, SM3 and SM4, “it doesn’t yet include the code needed to allow you to choose these algorithms as a ciphersuite for use in TLS connections.”

“You can’t ask your TLS client code to request a ShangMi connection to someone else’s server, as far as we can see; and you can’t get your TLS server code to accept a ShangMi connection from someone else’s client. “So the bug is in there, down in the low-level OpenSSL libcrypto code, but if you use OpenSSL at the TLS level to make or accept secure connections, we don’t think you can open up a session in which the buggy code could be triggered. “In our opinion, that greatly reduces the likelihood of criminals abusing this flaw to implant malware on your laptop, for example by luring you to a booby-trapped website and presenting you with a rogue certificate during connection setup.” —Sophos’s Paul Ducklin

Technical Details

The CVE-2021-3712 flaw is caused by a read buffer overrun weakness while processing ASN.1 strings. MITRE explains that ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure that contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length, as opposed to normal C strings that are represented as a buffer for the string data, which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. “If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit,” according to MITRE. That could lead to a crash, causing DoS or could also lead to disclosure of private memory contents, such as private keys or even sensitive content in plaintext.

Both of the OpenSSL bugs were fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l on Tuesday of last week.

Fix Them If You Can

Sophos’s Ducklin recommended upgrading to OpenSSL 1.1.1l if possible. “Although most software on Windows, Mac, iOS and Android will not be using OpenSSL, because those platforms have their own alternative TLS implementations, some software may include an OpenSSL build of its own and will need updating independently,” he noted. “If in doubt, consult your vendor. Most Linux distros will have a system-wide version of OpenSSL, so check with your distro for an update. (Note: Firefox doesn’t use OpenSSL on any platforms.)”

There’s no shortage of reasons to heed his advice, given that criminal gangs already have NAS devices in their crosshairs. In a report published a few weeks ago, Palo Alto Network Unit 42 researchers said that they’d discovered a new variant of the eCh0raix ransomware string that exploited a critical bug, CVE-2021-28799 – an improper authorization vulnerability that gives attackers access to hard-coded credentials so as to plant a backdoor account – in the Hybrid Backup Sync (HBS 3) software on QNAP’s NAS devices.

The nearly year-old eCh0raix ransomware strain has been used to target both QNAP and Synology network-attached storage (NAS) devices in past, separate campaigns, but the new variant is more efficient: It can target either vendors’ devices in a single campaign."

Application programming interfaces (APIs) have become the glue that holds today’s apps together. There’s an API to turn on the kitchen lights while still in bed. There’s an API to change the song playing on your house speakers. Whether the app is on your mobile device, entertainment system or garage door, APIs are what developers use to make applications function.

There are three major vulnerability types that cyberattackers target in order to “own” apps. But first, some background on what makes APIs such a security concern.

APIs can operate much the same way that a URL might operate. Typing “www.example[.]com” into a web browser will elicit a response from example.com. Search for your favorite song and you will see the following in the URL bar: “www.example.com/search?{myfavoritesong}.”

The page result is dynamically built to present you with your search findings. Your mobile banking app operates in the same manner, with the API grabbing your name, account number and account balance — and populating the fields in the pre-built pages accordingly. While APIs have similar characteristics to web applications, they are far more susceptible to attacks; they include the entire transaction, including any security checks, and are typically communicating directly to a back-end service.

Increased API Vulnerabilities: History Repeats Itself

In the late 1990s folks figured out that you could often drop a single quote ” ‘ ” into a search box or login field and the application would respond with a database error. Understanding SQL database syntax means that a vulnerable application was simply a wide-open application that one could potentially have total control over. And once found, SQL vulnerabilities were often attacked.

This reflects the problems we have had in application security forever: Input validation. Without proper function and security testing, APIs can become a perfect point of attack. Trusted by the application, with high-speed, massive data exchanges possible, APIs are a cause for concern for any organization that is utilizing them or developing them for use.

Top 3 API Vulnerabilities

In my work with customers in the application-security market and my long-time involvement in the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) community, I commonly see API vulnerability exploits. Here are three of the most common types:

Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA): The layperson’s definition of BOLA is “insufficient validation of an object access request,” which allows an attacker to perform an unauthorized action by reusing an access token. The Peloton security incident is one of many recent BOLA exploit examples where an attacker could view all of the data, including anything marked private, in another user’s profile. The business impact of the Peloton incident was significant, likely impacting every business group from development to operations to marketing and public relations.

Broken User Authentication: Defined as “implementation flaws in authentication mechanisms,” these bugs allow attackers to impersonate legitimate users. Two common types of exploits come to mind here. The first is credential stuffing executed by automated bots. Finding a login API with a broken user authentication flaw is a perfect target for an automated attack. A more sophisticated use of this flaw is for reconnaissance, to determine how the API works. If I put in a username/password combo of “a@a.com /” password and the application says “invalid password” then I know this is a valid username. An attacker will use this data point to increase their chances of credential-stuffing (or other type of attack) success.

Improper Assets Management: This API flaw is the result of “insufficient environment segregation and management,” and allows attackers to access under-secured API endpoints. In the recent John Deere security incident, a developer API that was part of the John Deere partner program had access to production data without redactions, [potentially] exposing John Deere customers utilizing the tractor giant’s Green Star system. Stating the obvious, the flaw lied in the lack of separation between the two environments. Additional gaps that fall into this category include not monitoring for sensitive data in a development API, and keeping deprecated APIs online/exposed.

Fixing the Problem

2021 is already the year of the API security incident, and the year is not over. API flaws impact the entire business – not just dev, or security or the business groups. Finger-pointing has never fixed the problem. The fix begins with collaboration; development needs a full understanding from business groups on how the API should function. API coding is different, so a refresh on secure coding practices is warranted. And security needs to be involved upfront, to help uncover gaps before publication.

A great place to start is with the OWASP. It has published the API Security Top 10 and recently published the Completely Ridiculous API, which includes examples of bad APIs in an application. Organizations can use the Completely Ridiculous API online or in-house as an educational platform to train development and security on the errors to avoid when utilizing APIs.

Whether you are utilizing an “API-first approach” or just starting your journey into digital transformation aided by APIs, knowing the vulnerabilities that are out there and what might happen if something is missed, is crucial.

“The entry() function is simple and calls FUN_1400d71c0():,” researchers wrote.
There they found the ransomware’s main function, the first part of which initializes a crypto library that LockFile likely uses for its encryption functions, they said.","Researchers from Sophos discovered the emerging threat in July, which exploits the ProxyShell vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange servers to attack systems.

Researchers discovered a novel ransomware emerging on the heels of the ProxyShell vulnerabilities discovery in Microsoft Exchange servers. The threat, dubbed LockFile, uses a unique “intermittent encryption” method as a way to evade detection as well as adopting tactics from previous ransomware gangs.

Discovered by researchers at Sophos, LockFile ransomware encrypts every 16 bytes of a file, which means some ransomware protection solutions don’t notice it because “an encrypted document looks statistically very similar to the unencrypted original,” Mark Loman, director, engineering, for next-gen technologies at Sophos, wrote in a report on LockFile published last week.

“We haven’t seen intermittent encryption used before in ransomware attacks,” he wrote.

The ransomware first exploits unpatched ProxyShell flaws and then uses what’s called a PetitPotam NTLM relay attack to seize control of a victim’s domain, researchers explained. In this type of attack, a threat actor uses Microsoft’s Encrypting File System Remote Protocol (MS-EFSRPC) to connect to a server, hijack the authentication session, and manipulate the results such that the server then believes the attacker has a legitimate right to access it, Sophos researchers described in an earlier report.

LockFile also shares some attributes of previous ransomware as well as other tactics—such as forgoing the need to connect to a command-and-control center to communicate–to hide its nefarious activities, researchers found.

“Like WastedLocker and Maze ransomware, LockFile ransomware uses memory mapped input/output (I/O) to encrypt a file,” Loman wrote in the report. “This technique allows the ransomware to transparently encrypt cached documents in memory and causes the operating system to write the encrypted documents, with minimal disk I/O that detection technologies would spot.”

Researchers analyzed LockFile using sample of the ransomware with the SHA-256 hash “bf315c9c064b887ee3276e1342d43637d8c0e067260946db45942f39b970d7ce” that they discovered on VirusTotal. Upon opening, the sample appears to have only three functions and three sections.

The first section, named OPEN, contains no data – only zeroes, researchers said. It’s the second section, CLSE, that includes the sample’s three functions. However, rest of the data in the section is encoded code that is decoded later and placed in the “OPEN” section, which researchers examined in depth, they said.

“The entry() function is simple and calls FUN_1400d71c0():,” researchers wrote. “The FUN_1400d71c0() function decodes the data from the CLSE section and puts it in the OPEN section. It also resolves the necessary DLLs and functions. Then it manipulates the IMAGE_SCN_CNT_UNINITIALIZED_DATA values and jumps to the code placed in the OPEN section.”

Researchers used WinDbg and .writemem to write the OPEN section to disk to analyze the code statically in Ghidra, an open-source reverse-engineering tool. There they found the ransomware’s main function, the first part of which initializes a crypto library that LockFile likely uses for its encryption functions, they said.

The ransomware then uses the Windows Management Interface (WMI) command-line tool WMIC.EXE–which is part of every Windows installation—to terminate all processes with vmwp in their name, repeating the process for other critical business processes associated with virtualization software and databases, researchers wrote.

“By leveraging WMI, the ransomware itself is not directly associated with the abrupt termination of these typical business critical processes,” they explained. “Terminating these processes will ensure that any locks on associated files/databases are released, so that these objects are ready for malicious encryption.”

LockFile renames encrypted documents to lower case and adds a .lockfile file extension, and also includes an HTML Application (HTA) ransom note looks very similar to that of LockBit 2.0, researchers said.

“In its ransom note, the LockFile adversary asks victims to contact a specific e-mail address: contact[@]contipauper.com,” they said, adding that the domain name—which seems to have been created on Aug. 16–appears to be a “derogatory reference” to the Conti Gang, a still-active and competing ransomware group.

Intermittent Encryption, Explained

The feature that most defines and differentiates LockFile from its competitors is not that it implements partial encryption per se — as LockBit 2.0, DarkSide and BlackMatter ransomware all do this, according to researchers. What sets LockFile apart is the unique way it employs this type of encryption, which has not been observed by a ransomware before, Loman said.

“What sets LockFile apart is that it doesn’t encrypt the first few blocks,” he wrote. “Instead, LockFile encrypts every other 16 bytes of a document. This means that a text document, for instance, remains partially readable.”

The “intriguing advantage” to this approach is that it can elude some ransomware protection technologies that use what’s called “chi-squared (chi^2)” analysis, skewing the statistical way this analysis is done and thus confusing it.

“An unencrypted text file of 481 KB (say, a book) has a chi^2 score of 3850061,” Loman explained. “If the document was encrypted by DarkSide ransomware, it would have a chi^2 score of 334 – which is a clear indication that the document has been encrypted. If the same document is encrypted by LockFile ransomware, it would still have a significantly high chi^2 score of 1789811.”

Once it has encrypted all the documents on the machine, LockFile disappears without a trace, deleting itself with a PING command, researchers said. “This means that after the ransomware attack, there is no ransomware binary for incident responders or antivirus software to find or clean up,” they wrote."

The Aruba AirWave management platform is HPE’s real-time monitoring and security alert system for wired and wireless infrastructures. The Sudo bug (CVE-2021-3156) was reported in January by Qualys researchers and is believed to impact millions of endpoint devices and systems.

Sudo is a program used by other platforms that “allows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands as root or another user,” according to the Sudo license.

Sudo Returns

At the time the Sudo bug was found, Mehul Revankar, Qualys’ VP of Product Management and Engineering, described the Sudo flaw in a research note as, “perhaps the most significant Sudo vulnerability in recent memory (both in terms of scope and impact) and has been hiding in plain sight for nearly 10 years.”

For HPE’s part, the company publicly disclosed the flaw last week and said it affected the AirWave management platform prior to version 8.2.13.0 – release on June 18, 2021.

“A vulnerability in the command line parameter parsing code of Sudo could allow an attacker with access to Sudo to execute commands or binaries with root privileges,” according to the security bulletin.

Qualys researchers named the Sudo vulnerability “Baron Samedit” and said the bug was introduced into the Sudo code in July 2011. The bug was first only believed to impact Linux and BSD operating systems, including versions of Linux ranging from Ubuntu 20.04 (Sudo 1.8.31), Debian 10 (Sudo 1.8.27) and Fedora 33 (Sudo 1.9.2). Since then, additional vendors have come forward with security warnings.

HPE may be the latest to report a Sudo dependency in its code, but it likely won’t be the last.

But in February, an Apple security bulletin warned that macOS (macOS Big Sur 11.2, macOS Catalina 10.15.7, macOS Mojave 10.14.6) contained the Sudo flaw inside an unspecified app. The news was followed by Apple’s release of a Sudo patch (Sudo version 1.9.5p2) to mitigate the issue.

HPE Offers Mitigation Against Sudo

In the context of Aruba AirWave management platform, according to researchers, the bug could be used to carry out privilege escalation attacks. “By triggering a ‘heap overflow’ in the app, it becomes possible to change a user’s low-privilege access to that of a root-level user. This is possible either by planting malware on a device or carrying out a brute force attack on a low-privilege Sudo account,” researchers wrote.

The Sudo bug is a heap-based buffer overflow, which lets any local user trick Sudo into running in “shell” mode. When Sudo is running in shell mode, researchers explain, “it escapes special characters in the command’s arguments with a backslash.” Then, a policy plug-in removes any escape characters before deciding on the Sudo user’s permissions.”

HPE says to mitigate the issue users should upgrade to AirWave management platform to 8.2.13.0 and above. Sudo also released a patch earlier this year. A technical workaround also is available for HPE AirWave customers:

“To minimize the likelihood of an attacker exploiting these vulnerabilities, Aruba recommends that the CLI and web-based management interfaces for AirWave be restricted to a dedicated layer 2 segment/VLAN and/or controlled by firewall policies at layer 3 and above,” wrote HPE."

The request for bids on the project, called Installations of the Future: Technology Pilot for Child Development Center, explained that the CCTV feeds aren’t constantly monitored by humans and the pilot program will explore whether AI could fill in the gaps.

“Video analytic software provides the added security of continual computer monitoring used as an addition to the human CCTV monitoring,” the request for bid said. “Moreover, it provides instant notifications to staff on a wide range of important AR 190-3 monitoring parameters as events occur.”

AI to Monitor Health and Well-Being?

The solicitation for contract laid out nebulous objectives to “monitor the health and well-being of children” at the childcare center.

The paperwork did detail cybersecurity parameters, which includes an interconnection agreement, adherence to the Department of Defense cybersecurity regulations and a requirement that any data stored be encrypted.

Other requirements include following the Security Technical Guides (STIGs), submission to Static Application Security Testing (SAST) for source code analysis, and an obligation to provide patching and mitigation support.

Facial-recognition software has regularly come under fire by security professionals and privacy advocates alike. Not only have facial-recognition algorithms been easily fooled, they’ve been decried as a privacy nightmare by groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, which sued to the Department of Homeland Security in March 2020 over its use of facial recognition in airports. Just months later, Sens. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) and Jeff Merkley (Ore.), both Democrats, introduced the National Biometric Information Privacy Act in an effort to curb the government’s ability to collect peoples’ biometric data.

With account takeover (ATO) attacks on the rise, stopping threat actors in the early phases of the kill chain will help today’s defenders gain an upper hand against direct fraud campaigns.

Understanding how and where these attacks are carried out and the underlying support structure enabling ATO are key to informing what types of defenses should be deployed to help reduce an organization’s risk – and associated pain – for customer account compromise. Let’s take a closer look at early stages of the kill chain – reconnaissance, weaponization and delivery – to examine how criminals gather leaked credentials, then validate this data to ultimately extract value from accounts they’ve gained access to for monetization.

As is the case with many types of cyberattacks, initial planning – or recon – for ATO starts in what is considered the internet’s underground economy, where threat actors communicate, coordinate and plan their criminal endeavors. It’s important to understand what type of activity and processes take place here to give more context for criminal motivations and help explain why ATO attacks are becoming commonplace.

As a quick refresher, many may not know that the Surface Web, what we consider the public internet (indexed by search engines), only makes up about 4 percent of the total volume of the internet. What is commonly called the Dark Web makes up roughly 6 percent of the internet. So what about the remaining unaccounted for 90 percent? The vast majority of the total internet consists of the Deep Web and is not indexed, as the data sits behind a protected database or service that requires a user login to access information. Credential gathering, data sharing and recon – the beginning of the ATO kill chain – starts here.

Credential gathering is the first phase. Attackers breach or skim sites, phish website users or purchase combo-lists of stolen credentials on the Dark Web. Oftentimes these lists of usernames and passwords have been exposed during a data breach. Pastebin, ControlC, Combo-lists.com and ZeroBin.net are examples of underground economy sites for attackers to find combo-lists.

Also, tools have actually been written to help facilitate the process for criminals. One such tool, D3vSpider, was written so that attackers can more easily search Pastebin to look for a username/password combinations; email/password combinations or proxy lists; or email addresses and URLs that might be interesting to target.

If the acquired combo-lists have recently been publicly leaked to sites, it’s important for attackers to quickly validate those credentials before knowledge of a public security breach puts password reset and other post-compromise security mechanisms into action. If a data breach has occurred, but is not yet made public, attackers can buy a list of credentials that have already been validated. And because the breach is still not yet publicly known, it’s less likely that the targeted company has taken any post-breach actions, nor have consumers been alerted to reset their passwords.

Once criminal actors have combo-lists in hand, they will then move into the second stage of the ATO kill chain.

The second stage is weaponization. During this phase and the next (delivery), attackers rely heavily on automation by building or renting botnets to scale credential-stuffing attacks against the target’s website to validate which credentials work. However, attackers can’t just directly launch into delivery.

First, they load the acquired combo-list into the botnet. Then, to increase their chances of a successful attack, they need to implement some botnet obfuscation techniques by either using proxy networks or bot nodes to make sure their activity is not easily identified. When an attacker is using common botnet attack tools like Snipr or Sentry MBA, they need to look like they are real users to evade detection.

As an example, attackers who are targeting U.S.-based companies no longer launch attacks from out-of-country IP addresses, because that would be too obvious and easily flagged as suspicious account activity.

Instead, they attempt to look like they’re coming from in-country cloud providers and data center IP addresses. But enterprise defenders realized that “actual” users don’t typically access sites from data center IP addresses; instead, legitimate users are more likely to come from ISP-based IP addresses (think residential). Attackers saw that they were getting detected and have pivoted to using proxy services or bot nodes that are proxied through compromised IoT devices located on home networks. Many nefarious proxy services are even advertised on Twitter, noting that they specialize in allowing access through proxies with residential IP addresses.

Next, it’s time for the delivery phase of the kill chain. With obfuscation techniques in place and combo-lists locked and loaded into botnet tools, attackers are ready to launch a credential-stuffing attack.

Here’s an overview of how that attack might play out.

The credential-stuffing attack can be volumetric, trying to log in from a few devices and testing thousands of credentials per second. Or the attack can be “low and slow,” using more devices and fewer requests per second in hopes of avoiding detection. But each attempted login by the botnet works the same way to try and validate the account.

The botnet uses the usernames and passwords to see if the site lets the attacker in, thinking it’s the account owner. Maybe the login attempt fails, as many attempts will. For example, perhaps the legitimate owner of the credentials doesn’t have a PayPal account. Maybe they changed their password recently. Or likely the site is protected with some kind of challenge action or step-up authentication via email or text to prove the account owner’s identity.

But some stolen credentials will work, and the attackers only need a small percentage of their list to be validated for the attack to be financially successful. The process continues until the attacker has tested all the credentials in the combo-list. Keep in mind that attackers might execute the account-takeover attack themselves, but it’s also very common for criminals to sell validated credentials to another criminal group operating within the internet’s underground economy.

Now with valid credentials, the attacker will be ready to move onto the next phases of the ATO kill chain – where human driven intervention completes the final stages of a direct fraud campaign. In part II of this blog series, we’ll examine the tactics and techniques of human fraudsters performing targeted attacks against individual user accounts and how organizations can be better prepared to fight back.

Stay tuned for Part II, next week!

A serious security vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Server that researchers have dubbed ProxyToken could allow an unauthenticated attacker to access and steal emails from a target’s mailbox.

Microsoft Exchange uses two websites; one, the front end, is what users connect to in order to access email. The second is a back-end site that handles the authentication function.

“The front-end website is mostly just a proxy to the back end. To allow access that requires forms authentication, the front end serves pages such as /owa/auth/logon.aspx,” according to a Monday posting on the bug from Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative. “For all post-authentication requests, the front end’s main role is to repackage the requests and proxy them to corresponding endpoints on the Exchange Back End site. It then collects the responses from the back end and forwards them to the client.”

The issue arises specifically in a feature called “Delegated Authentication,” where the front end passes authentication requests directly to the back end. These requests contain a SecurityToken cookie that identify them; i.e., if the front end finds a non-empty cookie named SecurityToken, it delegates authentication to the back end. However, Exchange has to be specifically configured to have the back end perform the authentication checks; in a default configuration, the module responsible for that (the “DelegatedAuthModule”) isn’t loaded.

“When the front end sees the SecurityToken cookie, it knows that the back end alone is responsible for authenticating this request,” according to ZDI. “Meanwhile, the back end is completely unaware that it needs to authenticate some incoming requests based upon the SecurityToken cookie, since the DelegatedAuthModule is not loaded in installations that have not been configured to use the special delegated authentication feature. The net result is that requests can sail through, without being subjected to authentication on either the front or back end.”

From there, attacker could install a forwarding rule allowing them to read the victim’s incoming mail.

“With this vulnerability, an unauthenticated attacker can perform configuration actions on mailboxes belonging to arbitrary users,” according to the post. “As an illustration of the impact, this can be used to copy all emails addressed to a target and account and forward them to an account controlled by the attacker.”

ZDI outlined an exploitation scenario wherein an attacker has an account on the same Exchange server as the victim. However, if an administrator permits forwarding rules having arbitrary internet destinations, no Exchange credentials are needed at all, researchers noted.

The bug (CVE-2021-33766) was reported to the Zero Day Initiative by researcher Le Xuan Tuyen of VNPT ISC, and it was patched by Microsoft in the July Exchange cumulative updates. Organizations should update their products to avoid compromise.

The ProxyToken revelation comes after the disclosure of ProxyLogon in early March; that’s an exploit chain comprised of four Exchange flaws (CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, CVE-2021-27065), which together create a pre-authentication remote code execution (RCE) exploit. Attackers can take over unpatched servers without knowing any valid account credentials, giving them access to email communications and the opportunity to install a web shell for further exploitation within the environment. ProxyLogon was weaponized in wide-scale attacks throughout the spring.

A day earlier, on Thursday, Bangkok Airways publicly acknowledged that it had been blasted with a cyberattack a week ago, on Monday, Aug. 23. It’s still investigating the incident “as a matter of urgency,” the company said in a press release, and is working on beefing up its defenses.

“Upon such discovery, the company immediately took action to investigate and contain the event, with the assistance of a cybersecurity team. Currently, the company is investigating, as a matter of urgency, to verify the compromised data and the affected passengers as well as taking relevant measures to strengthen its IT system.” —Bangkok Airways press release

So far, it looks like affected personal data belonging to passengers include:

Passenger name

Family name

Nationality

Gender

Phone number

Email address

Other contact information

Passport information

Historical travel information

Partial credit-card information

Special meal information

The attackers evidently didn’t manage to access Bangkok Airway’s operational or aeronautical security systems, the company said. The company apologized, saying that “Bangkok Airways Public Company Limited takes the protection of passenger’s data very seriously and the airline is deeply sorry for the worry and inconvenience that this malicious incident has caused.”

The airline said that it has notified the proper authorities, including the Royal Thai police.

LockBit 2.0

LockBit 2.0 is similar to its ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) brethren DarkSide and REvil: Like those other operations. LockBit uses an affiliate model to rent out its ransomware platform, taking a cut of any ransom payments that result.

The gang went on a hiring spree in the wake of DarkSide and REvil both shutting down operations, putting up wallpaper on compromised systems that includes text inviting insiders to help compromise systems and promising payouts of millions of dollars.

Earlier this month, LockBit attacked Accenture, a global business consulting firm with an insider track on some of the world’s biggest, most powerful companies.

At the time, Cyble researchers suggested in a Tweet stream that the Accenture attack could have been an insider job. “We know #LockBit #threatactor has been hiring corporate employees to gain access to their targets’ networks,” they tweeted, along with a clock counting down how much time was left for Accenture to cough up the ransom.

According to a report released two weeks ago by Trend Micro, attacks in July and August have employed LockBit 2.0 ransomware that feature a souped-up encryption method.

Threatpost has reached out to DarkTracer for more details and an update, and has reached out to DarkTrace to find out more about its near-namesake. We also reached out to Bangkok Airways for more details, including whether a ransom has been demanded, whether the company has figured out how many customers were affected by the breach and whether it plans to offer identity-theft protection.

Watch Out for Phishing Attempts

Bangkok Airways recommends that passengers contact their bank or credit-card provider and change any compromised passwords ASAP. Also, it recommended that passengers keep their eyes out for suspicious or unsolicited calls and/or emails – particularly phishing attempts claiming to be coming from Bangkok Airways that attempt to gather personal data.

Bangkok Airways won’t be contacting customers to ask for payment-card details or the like, it said. If passengers experience such phishing attempts, Bangkok Airways said that they should report it to law enforcement and to the airline, at:

Toll-free number 1-800-010-171 (within Thailand) between 8 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. (Thai local time)

Toll number 800-8100-6688 (Overseas) during between 8 a.m. and 5:30 pm (Thai local time)

Email: infosecurity@bangkokair.com

Step Numero Uno: IDing Point of Entry

Quentin Rhoads-Herrera, director of professional services at managed detection and response (MDR) services provider CRITICALSTART, observed that Bangkok Airways has a tall order ahead of it when it comes to notifying affected customers in several different countries. Just one complication is the fact that it entails different regulatory bodies overseeing various regulations – the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules, for example.

“The primary thing Bangkok Air needs to do is identify the point of entry used by LockBit,” Rhoads-Herrera observed to Threatpost on Monday. “If LockBit group was able to gain entry due to an unpatched externally facing system, then not only do they need to evaluate their current external exposure, but they also need to improve their overall asset inventory and patch management processes to ensure systems are updated often. Understanding the way the criminals initially gained entry is pivotal to ensuring this doesn’t occur in the future.”

He stressed that Bangkok Air also needs to understand everything LockBit did once on the inside to ensure that it hardens its defenses and alerts on similar future activities. “With enough determination, any criminal can breach a company,” Rhoads-Herrera commented via email. “This is why it is very important that organizations work to lowering their time to detect and respond as much as possible to limit the damage of such a breach.”

BHe also noted that – assuming that this was a ransomware strike – the fact that it’s coupled with a threat to disclose data makes it a double extortion attack, in which the injury of paralyzed systems is compounded by the misery of threatened information disclosure.

All the more reason to test backup infrastructure, he noted: “It’s very important that organizations not only protect their backup infrastructure so they can recover after a breach but also protect their most important data and alert on large data leaving their infrastructure. In this instance, the data LockBit has obtained can be used to extort Bangkok Airways for additional crypto currency or they can release it as a way to damage the brand of Bangkok Airways at the same time of receiving notoriety as a criminal organization.”

T-Mobile is “humbled,” it said, announcing new partnerships with security heavyweights on Friday.

On Thursday, a 21-year-old US citizen claiming to be the attacker who stole data on more than 50 million T-Mobile customers called the telecom’s security “awful.”

On Friday, a “humbled” T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert wiped the egg from his face and apologized for the debacle, the repercussions of which have affected a total of more than 50 million customers at this point. As of Aug. 18, T-Mobile had estimated the total number of ripped-off records to be ~40 million: a number that rose to ~50 million on Aug. 20 and could double if the purported thief is true to his word.

When the breach was widely reported 11 days ago, the purported thief was offering to sell 30 million records for ~1 penny each on an underground forum: what he claimed was a subset of 100 million customer records. He alleged that he was going to sell the other 50 million privately. As of Thursday, he hadn’t acknowledged having sold any of the records.

The Wall Street Journal has been chatting with the purported attacker via Telegram for a while. The news outlet has confirmed that his name is John Binns: a 21-year-old US citizen of Turkish descent who moved to Turkey a few years ago. Binns reportedly discussed details about the breach before they were widely known.

The WSJ noted that T-Mobile was initially notified of the breach by a cybersecurity company called Unit221B LLC, which said that the telecom’s customer data was being peddled on the dark web.

Who is John Binns?

Binns told the WSJ that he conducted the attack from his home in Izmir, Turkey, where he lives with his mother. His father, who died when he was two, was American, while his mother is Turkish. They moved back to Turkey when Binns was 18.

If the name rings a bell, it’s because the seller told Alon Gal, CTO of cybercrime intelligence firm Hudson Rock, that this sucker-punch to US infrastructure was done in retaliation against the US for the kidnapping and torture of John Binns at the hands of CIA and Turkish intelligence agents in 2019, as Gal tweeted at the time (from an account that has since been suspended).

This breach was done to retaliate against the US for the kidnapping and torture of John Erin Binns (CIA Raven-1) in Germany by CIA and Turkish intelligence agents in 2019. We did it to harm US infrastructure. —Attacker’s alleged statement to Gal

It’s not clear who “we” refers to, but Binns said he needed help. In his conversation with the WSJ, Binns described the attack as a “collaborative effort to find the login credentials needed to crack T-Mobile’s internal databases,” and that another online actor offered, in online forums, to sell some of the stolen T-Mobile data.

Binns sued the FBI, CIA and Department of Justice in 2020, alleging that he was tortured and harassed by the US and Turkish governments and is seeking to compel the US to release documents regarding these activities under the Freedom of Information Act. He told the WSJ that the kidnapping story is legitimate – why would he lie?:

I have no reason to make up a fake kidnapping story and I’m hoping that someone within the FBI leaks information about that. —John Binns, as quoted by the WSJ

Binns reportedly uses the online handles IRDev and v0rtex, among others. He’s apparently got a track record that includes “peripheral involvement” in the creation of a massive botnet of compromised devices that was used for online attacks four years ago, having been in cahoots with the gamers who infected devices around the world.

These botnets are often used by gamers to knock people and websites offline in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The pandemic caused a surge in such attacks: As of September 2020, more people were online during lockdowns and work-from-home shifts, making for lucrative pickings for DDoS-ers.

T-Mobile’s ‘Awful’ Security

Binns told the WSJ that he penetrated T-Mobile’s defenses in July after scanning the company’s known internet addresses, looking for weak spots and using what the publication called “a simple tool available to the public.” (That tool well might have been Shodan: a search engine used to uncover servers connected to the internet that’s often used by threat actors and researchers to find vulnerabilities.)

He found an unprotected, exposed router last month, he told the Journal. From there, Binns said he managed to break into T-Mobile’s data center outside East Wenatchee, Wash., where he reportedly accessed more than 100 servers that contained the personal data of millions. By Aug. 4, he had stolen millions of files thanks to what he told the Journal was the mobile phone seller’s pathetic security:

I was panicking because I had access to something big. Their security is awful. —John Binns, as quoted by the WSJ

Cybersecurity experts have been nodding vigorously, albeit in more diplomatic terms than “awful.” The Journal spoke with Glenn Gerstell, a former general counsel for the National Security Agency, who said that the fact that the theft included records stolen from prospective clients or former, long-gone customers shows that somebody or somebodies at T-Mobile isn’t practicing good data management hygiene: “That to me does not sound like good data management practices,” he was quoted as saying.

Granted, that work gets harder all the time. Randy Watkins, chief technology officer at cybersecurity consulting and managed detection and response (MDR) services company CRITICALSTART, told Threatpost on Friday that the attack shows how difficult it is to secure growing perimeters and how tough it is to monitor attack surfaces.

Watkins warned that alerts set off by an intruder’s activity – including initial compromise, subsequent lateral movement and data exfiltration– are dismissed at an organization’s peril: “Even if this generated alerts, they would likely be low-priority, and something that would be disregarded as a likely false-positive,” he said via email. “As attackers take advantage of these less-obvious tactics, it is becoming more critical to resolve every alert generated by detection toolsets.”

Something’s Wrong in Magenta Land

By some accounts, this is the sixth time that T-Mobile has been attacked in recent years.

The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said last week that it’s investigating this most recent breach. T-Mobile is also facing at least two class-action lawsuits accusing the company, the second-largest US wireless carrier, of failing to protect customer data.

T-Mobile was attacked twice last year, and in 2018, about 2.5 million customers had their data exposed in a network breach. That attack also became part of a federal class-action lawsuit.

The most recent theft involved the records of more than 13 million current customers, more than 40 million prospective customers who had applied for credit with the company, and 667,000 former customers, T-Mobile said last week. An additional 902,000 prepaid customers also had some data exposed.

Some records contained Social Security numbers, phone numbers, names, security PINs, physical addresses, unique IMEI numbers, IMSI numbers, driver license numbers and dates of birth: in short, all the ingredients necessary for identity theft.

A source familiar with the investigation told the WSJ that the Seattle office of the FBI is investigating.

The Latest From T-Mobile

On Friday, T-Mobile’s CEO, Mike Sievert, announced that the company has sought help on the cybersecurity front. He said in a statement that the company has entered into long-term partnerships with Mandiant and with consulting firm KPMG LLP.

“We know we need additional expertise to take our cybersecurity efforts to the next level – and we’ve brought in the help,” Sievert said. “These arrangements are part of a substantial multi-year investment to adopt best-in-class practices and transform our approach. This is all about assembling the firepower we need to improve our ability to fight back against criminals and building a future-forward strategy to protect T-Mobile and our customers.”

With regards to details behind the attack, Sievert painted this as the work of an erudite threat actor. “What we can share is that, in simplest terms, the bad actor leveraged their knowledge of technical systems, along with specialized tools and capabilities, to gain access to our testing environments and then used brute force attacks and other methods to make their way into other IT servers that included customer data,” he was quoted as saying in Friday’s statement.

Security experts weren’t too sure about T-Mobile’s characterization of this as a fancy attack.

Well, Good Luck With All That

Some security experts said that the move to pull in the security big guns is a good step, but T-Mobile’s got a lot of gunk to scrape out, and it won’t happen overnight. Ian McShane, Field CTO of security firm Arctic Wolf and former Gartner analyst, told Threatpost that, given how many breaches T-Mobile has suffered over the last few years, he’s already skeptical about the company’s claims that the breach was a “highly sophisticated” attack. “I’m sure many others in our industry will be just as keen as I am to understand the cause and the lessons learned, especially as it seems the internal investigation was only sparked by posts from a Twitter account with what appeared to be inside knowledge,” he said.

Mark Manglicmot, vice president of security services at Arctic Wolf, told Threatpost that one of the poor practices brought to light by the breach is storing Social Security numbers in plain text. “Encryption of this data is a mandatory part of the security equation,” he pointed out.

Moreover, since this is T-Mobile’s sixth such breach in a few years, it’s apparent “they haven’t taken security seriously enough,” Manglicmot continued. “Their IT asset management and patching of systems is poor. The combination of poor defenses and a lack of capable real-time detection and response is a recipe for this type of data theft disaster. Once a data rich company like T-Mobile experiences a breach, the flood-gates open to other attackers to find additional cracks. Reports are stating their security is a mess. It’s a good step that they are bringing in reputable help to investigate and bolster defenses, but it’s going to take T-Mobile years to fully get their security program on par with their responsibility to customers.”

Then too, there’s that throbbing sore thumb: namely, the exposed router. Agio founder and CEO Bart McDonough pointed out to Threatpost that the unsecured router that Binns claimed to have exploited “appears to have had a different configuration than other routers. The hacker exploited the weakness in this non-standard configuration.” T-Mobile should have had an AI-based anomaly detection system in place, he said: one that might have caught the aberrant login and resulting data exfiltration, “allowing T-Mobile to perhaps minimize the damage from this attack.”

Many businesses aren’t as complex as T-Mobile; nor do they get targeted with such intensity. Still, there are lessons to be learned for other businesses, McDonough observed. “All businesses could benefit from enhancing their cybersecurity fundamentals. Specifically, deploying device configuration management, access management, and AI-based detection of anomalous and suspicious network activity.”

As it is, many, if not most, organizations only have a static awareness of their “surface”, e.g. internal systems exposed to the Internet, he continued. “When an administrator makes a change (or mistake) the new exposure point should set off alarms and someone should be asking the question ‘is that system, router, etc. presenting what we are intending?'”

Microservices allow enterprises to efficiently manage infrastructure, easily deploy updates or improvements, and help IT teams innovate, fail, and learn faster. It also allows enterprises to craft applications that can easily scale with demand. Additionally, as enterprises switch architectures — jumping from the traditional monolithic to microservices — the need for efficient communication between microservices arises. This critical and complex communication between client and server applications can be handled by gRPC, a universal remote procedure call (RPC) framework that facilitates the transparent and efficient communication between connected systems. Although quite new (having only been developed by Google in 2015), it has quickly gained popularity and adoption.

In this blog, we will discuss the security pitfalls that developers might face when shifting to gRPC and implementing gRPC in their projects. Because secure gRPC APIs play a pivotal role in overall application security, we provide recommendations on how to protect gRPC implementations from threats and mitigate against risks.

What is gRPC?

gRPC can be used to design new protocols that require accuracy, efficiency, and language independence as it supports multiple languages for both servers and clients. It is a Cloud Native Computing (CNCF) project and has been adopted by major companies such as popular video-streaming site Netflix, financial services company Square, and platform as a Service (PaaS) company Docker.

gRPC is compared to other RPC frameworks, such as SOAP and REST. Though RESTful APIs are widely used and typically use HTTP to exchange information between apps or services and the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data format, they have performance and text-based orientation limitations.

Many organizations have migrated their APIs from REST to gRPC to take advantage of gRPC’s binary protocol that is better suited for interservice communications. gRPC uses the HTTP/2, a binary-based protocol, as an underlayer by default. HTTP/2 supports multiple streams and requests within one TCP connection, unlike its predecessor, HTTP/1.0, which was designed to have a “single request, single reply” scheme. HTTP pipelining addressed this issue in HTTP/1.1; however, HTTP 2.0 is still more performant and supported."

Upon further investigation, we discovered that a developer’s Xcode project at large contained the source malware, which leads to a rabbit hole of malicious payloads. Most notable in our investigation is the discovery of two zero-day exploits: one is used to steal cookies via a flaw in the behavior of Data Vaults, another is used to abuse the development version of Safari.

This scenario is quite unusual; in this case, malicious code is injected into local Xcode projects so that when the project is built, the malicious code is run. This poses a risk for Xcode developers in particular. The threat escalates since we have identified affected developers who shared their projects on GitHub, leading to a supply-chain-like attack for users who rely on these repositories as dependencies in their own projects. We have also identified this threat in sources such as VirusTotal, which indicates this threat is at large.

This blog will summarize the findings of this threat, while its accompanying technical brief contains the full details of this attack. We detected the entry threat as TrojanSpy.MacOS.XCSSET.A and its command and control (C&C) related files as Backdoor.MacOS.XCSSET.A.

This threat primarily spreads via Xcode projects and maliciously modified applications created from the malware. It is not yet clear how the threat initially enters these systems. Presumably, these systems would be primarily used by developers. These Xcode projects have been modified such that upon building, these projects would run a malicious code. This eventually leads to the main XCSSET malware being dropped and run on the affected system. Infected users are also vulnerable to having their credentials, accounts, and other vital data stolen.

Once present on an affected system, XCSSET is capable of the following behavior:

Using exploits, it abuses the existing the Safari and other installed browsers to steal user data. In particular, it

Uses a vulnerability to read and dump Safari cookies

Uses the Safari development version to inject JavaScript backdoors onto websites via a Universal Cross-site Scripting (UXSS) attack

It steals information from the user’s Evernote, Notes, Skype, Telegram, QQ ,and WeChat apps

It takes screenshots of the user’s current screen

It uploads files from the affected machines to the attacker’s specified server

It encrypts files and shows a ransom note, if commanded by the server

The UXSS attack is theoretically capable of modifying almost every part of the user’s browser experience as arbitrary JavaScript-injected code. These modifications include:

Modifying displayed websites

Modifying /replacing Bitcoin/cryptocurrency addresses

Stealing amoCRM, Apple ID, Google, Paypal, SIPMarket, and Yandex credentials

Stealing credit card information from the Apple Store

Blocking the user from changing passwords but also stealing newly modified passwords

Capturing screenshots of certain accessed sites

The method of distribution used can only be described as clever. Affected developers will unwittingly distribute the malicious trojan to their users in the form of the compromised Xcode projects, and methods to verify the distributed file (such as checking hashes) would not help as the developers would be unaware that they are distributing malicious files.

Further details of this attack may be found in its related technical brief.

The August batch of Patch Tuesday updates includes 120 updates for the Microsoft suite, with 17 fixes rated as Critical, and the remaining 103 ranked as Important. CVE-2020-1380 is a critical Internet Explorer (IE) vulnerability that can be abused for remote code execution (RCE), while CVE-2020-1464 is a Windows 10 security gap that can be used for spoofing. Administrators are advised to update their systems as soon as possible as both flaws have been found being exploited in the wild. The Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) disclosed 11 flaws, five of which are critical bugs that disclosed RCE vulnerabilities, while the remaining six are rated as important vulnerabilities that can be abused to gain escalation of privileges, RCE, information disclosure, and spoofing.

Currently abused in the wild

Two of the fixes address updates for vulnerabilities currently being exploited in the wild. CVE-2020-1380 is a scripting engine memory corruption vulnerability in IE11 that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code as the current user when abused. The scripting engine can be corrupted in the way it handles objects in memory and allows an attacker to view and edit data, create new accounts with full user rights, and install other programs if the logged-in user has full administrative rights.

Malicious actors can use several methods to exploit this gap. An attacker can create a specially crafted website to exploit the flaw through IE by prompting the user with social engineering techniques, or by embedding ActiveX controls to open it with an IE browser. They can also use compromised websites or pages that accept or host user-generated content and advertisements that could exploit the vulnerability.

Meanwhile, CVE-2020-1464 is a spoofing vulnerability that occurs when Windows incorrectly validates files’ digital signatures. An attacker can exploit this flaw to bypass security features and load malicious files, such as PDFs or Office file documents, onto systems.

Other critical IE, Outlook and HTML flaws via RCE

This release also includes three other fixes for critical network vulnerabilities. CVE-2020-1567 is an MSHTML engine improper input validation flaw that an attacker can exploit using a specially crafted file loaded by the current user to run arbitrary code. If the current user has full administrative rights in the system, the attacker can use it to install programs; view, change, and delete data; and create new accounts with the same user rights.

CVE-2020-1483 is an Outlook memory corruption vulnerability that can be used to run arbitrary code in the current user’s context. It affects a user with full administrative rights more severely compared to a user with fewer rights, but will nonetheless have some control and make unauthorized changes in the software. An attacker can exploit this flaw by convincing a user to open a malicious email or attachment, or use a compromised or malicious website via an embedded link included in the message. The preview pane can also serve as an attack vector in versions of Microsoft 365, Office 2019, and Outlook.

CVE-2020-1570 can be exploited by an attacker to run malicious code remotely through IE. This scripting engine memory corruption gap could allow an attacker to take control of a system with full user rights. Similar to CVE-2020-1380, an attacker can compromise legitimate websites or create a specific page to exploit the vulnerability and prompting the user to load the site using IE.

Trend Micro solutions

Vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild imply that cybercriminals may already be studying or creating routines that can abuse these gaps in systems. And while security administrators might simultaneously implement some of the updates, users — especially those who are currently working from home — are advised to download the individual patches for their systems immediately.

Water Nue Campaign AnalysisThe attackers use cloud-based email distribution services like SendGrid to deliver emails with a clickable link that redirects targets to a fake Office 365 page.","A series of ongoing business email compromise (BEC) campaigns that uses spear-phishing schemes on Office 365 accounts has been seen targeting business executives of over 1,000 companies across the world since March 2020. The recent campaigns target senior positions in the United States and Canada.

The fraudsters, whom we named “Water Nue,” primarily target accounts of financial executives to obtain credentials for further financial fraud. The phishing emails redirect users to fake Office 365 login pages. Once the credentials are obtained and accounts are successfully compromised, emails containing invoice documents with tampered banking information are sent to subordinates in an attempt to siphon money through fund transfer requests.

Tracking Water Nue’s activities

The threat actor behind this campaign is interesting for several reasons. It appears that their technical capabilities are limited despite being able to successfully target high-level employees globally. While their phishing tools are basic (i.e., no backdoors, trojans, and other malware), they made use of public cloud services to conduct their operations. The use of cloud services allowed them to obfuscate their operations by hosting infrastructures in the services themselves, making their activities tougher to spot for forensics. This tactic has become more commonplace among cybercriminals.

We first noticed the campaign from a large group of email domains used in phishing attempts. We found that most of the recipients hold high corporate positions, particularly in the finance department. In one of the first cases we encountered, the senior financial officer of a bank located in Africa purportedly sent a PDF invoice to a colleague, specifying a bank account in Hong Kong. The email was sent from an IP address recorded on one of the phishing sites that the attacker tested its functionality on.

The campaign is ongoing, with the threat actor switching to new infrastructures when used domain names get reported or blacklisted in systems.

Water Nue Campaign Analysis

The attackers use cloud-based email distribution services like SendGrid to deliver emails with a clickable link that redirects targets to a fake Office 365 page. (We have reached out to SendGrid and shared our findings with them.) When the target user attempts to log in, credentials are recorded through a simple PHP script."

Routine

As previously reported, the security bug involves a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the management interface of BIG-IP known as the Traffic Management User Interface (TMUI). After analyzing the published information, we noticed from the mitigation rule in Apache httpd that a possible way to exploit this vulnerability involves a HTTP GET request containing semicolon character in the URI. In a Linux command line, a semi-colon signals to the interpreter that a command line has finished, and it is a character the vulnerability needs to be triggered.

Developments on the malware have been reported by MalwareBytes, BleepingComputer and security researchers Dinesh Devadoss, Phil Stokes, Patrick Wardle, and Thomas Reed.

The aforementioned reports state the assumption that the malware’s ransomware activity is not its main attack method; rather, it is a pre-emptive move to disguise its other capabilities such as file exfiltration, Command and Control (C&C) communication, and keylogging. This assumption is also supported by our recent discoveries.

Given that both the previously mentioned researchers and the updated report from Objective-See have conducted an in-depth look into the malware, in this blog post we will discuss our own discoveries such as the differences between the old and new versions of the malware, including unusual observations in VirusTotal. More importantly, we’d like to add to the current information provided by published reports that prove our belief that ThiefQuest is an example of highly capable malware that should be kept under close monitoring.

New ThiefQuest variants

New functions

Besides the old ThiefQuest variant that has been reported by various researchers, we also discovered some improved variants with stronger capabilities and other changes compared with earlier iterations of the malware. For instance, these new variants seem to emerge only days after the detection of older variants. Notably, previously encountered ransomware behavior, such as file encryption and ransom note dropping, have been removed.

These new updates are not called by the main code of the malware, and through further investigation, we discovered that the authors have implemented a new routine for computing and calling the new functions’ addresses. Other versions of these new variants have even obfuscated the function names to make malware tracing more difficult."

.NET Framework, SharePoint Server, and Visual Studio RCE

This month’s security releases include a fix for an RCE vulnerability (CVE-2020-1147) in Microsoft .NET Framework, Visual Studio, and collaborative platform SharePoint. Users with affected installations are urged to immediately apply the update to address potential risks.

The vulnerability is concerned with the way the source markup of XML file input is validated. If left unpatched, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability and run arbitrary code in the context of the process responsible for the deserialization of XML content.

Microsoft Office Elevation of Privilege

CVE-2020-1025 is a Critical-rated elevation of privilege (EoP) vulnerability that occurs in SharePoint and Skype for Business servers. The flaw exists when these kinds of software mishandle OAuth token validation. An attacker who successfully modifies the token can bypass authentication and gain improper access.

This discovery is a new addition to the Mirai variants that appeared in the past few months, that include SORA, UNSTABLE, and Mukashi. The case, however, showcases the ever-expanding arsenal of vulnerabilities new Mirai variants are equipped with by their developers.

The vulnerabilities

The vulnerabilities used by this Mirai variant consist of a combination of old and new that help cast a wide net encompassing different types of connected devices. The nine vulnerabilities used in this campaign affect specific versions of IP cameras, smart TVs, and routers, among others.

As mentioned earlier, the most notable of these vulnerabilities is CVE-2020-10173, a Multiple Authenticated Command injection vulnerability found in Comtrend VR-3033 routers. Remote malicious attackers can use this vulnerability to compromise the network managed by the router.

Only a proof of concept (POC) has been released for this vulnerability, with no reported exploit at large before this Mirai variant. Figure 1 serves as evidence of how this vulnerability is used by the sample.

Figure 1. Code snippet that shows the use of CVE-2020-10173

Another relatively recent vulnerability also used in this campaign is Netlink GPON Router 1.0.11 RCE. Discovered this year, it was reportedly exploited by the Bashlite/Gafgyt variant Hoaxcalls.

Figure 2. Code snippet that shows the use of Netlink GPON Router 1.0.11 RCE

Aside from the two, the variant makes use of mostly old vulnerabilities which have been used in past campaigns. The two code snippets shown in figures 3 and 4 serve as examples of old vulnerabilities written in the variant’s code.

Figure 3. Code snippet that shows the use of LG SuperSign EZ CMS 2.5 - Remote Code Execution

Figure 4. Code snippet that shows the use of Linksys E-series - Remote Code Execution

In addition to these examples, the remaining five old vulnerabilities that were exploited by the variant are the following:

Brute-force capabilities

A hallmark of Mirai variants is the use of Telnet and Secure Shell (SSH) brute-forcing as evidenced by our sample. This variant also used the typical XOR encryption (with the XOR key: 0x04) to hide the credentials that it uses to attack vulnerable devices. The credentials we extracted are listed here.

Conclusion and security recommendations



The use of CVE-2020-10173 in this variant’s code shows how botnet developers continue to expand their arsenal to infect as many targets as possible and take advantage of the opening afforded by unpatched devices. Newly discovered vulnerabilities, in particular, offer better chances for cybercriminals. Users, not knowing that a vulnerability even exists, might be unable to patch the device before it is too late.

In the future, it would be wise to expect this vulnerability might be used in new DDoS botnets like Mirai. As monitoring of such botnets show, handlers tend to copy each other’s techniques, including lists of vulnerabilities and credentials that increase their chance of success.

For devices to remain safe from the usual tactics of botnet malware, users need to follow best practices in securing their connected devices. These include the following:

Patch vulnerabilities and apply updates as soon as they become available.

Use network segmentation to limit the spread of potential infections.

Use strong passwords and quickly change default ones.

Apply secure configurations for devices to limit unforeseen openings for infection.

Connected devices can also be protected by security software such as the Trend Micro™ Home Network Security and Trend Micro™ Home Network Security SDK solutions, which can check internet traffic between the router and all connected devices as well as help users asses for vulnerabilities.

The data breach in the Indonesian government’s electronic Health Alert Card (eHAC) program was discovered by a research team at vpnMentor led by Noam Rotem and Ran Locar.

The program and the eHAC app were created in 2021 to monitor the coronavirus infection status of people entering the country. Obtaining an eHAC was mandatory for any traveler, including native Indonesians, when entering the Republic from overseas or taking a domestic flight within Indonesia.

Researchers discovered that the app's developers ""failed to implement adequate data privacy protocols and left the data of over 1 million people exposed on an open server.""

In total, 2GB of data belonging to the Republic's Ministry of Health were exposed on an Elasticsearch server. Researchers said the data included more than 1.4 million records and that approximately 1.3 million individuals had been impacted.

Information left unsecured included Personal Identifiable Information (PII), medical records, contact details, travel information, and COVID-19 infection status.

Researchers noted: ""Had the data been discovered by malicious or criminal hackers, and allowed to accumulate data on more people, the effects could have been devastating on an individual and societal level.""

The database of unprotected records was discovered by researchers on July 15. It was reported to the Ministry of Health on July 21 and to the Indonesian Computer Emergency Response Team (ID-CERT) on July 22.

“Our team discovered eHAC’s records with zero obstacles, due to the lack of protocols put in place by the app’s developers,"" wrote researchers in a blog post detailing the leak.

""Once they investigated the database and confirmed the records were authentic, we contacted the Indonesian Ministry of Health and presented our findings.”

Despite twice flagging the open database to the Indonesian government and CERT, the researchers only received a response about the security incident in August after contacting Indonesia’s National Cyber and Encryption Agency (BSSN), which shut down the server on August 24.

DuPage Medical Group (DMG) said that patient data could have been compromised when its computer network was hacked last month.

On Monday, DMG announced that it would be mailing letters to 600,000 patients to warn them of the potential threat to their data's security.

Patient information that may have been accessed by the hackers includes names, addresses, dates of birth, diagnosis codes, information on medical procedures, and treatment dates. For some patients, there is a chance that their Social Security number may also have been compromised.

The cyber-attack, which took place on July 13, caused a network outage at DMG. Third-party cyber-forensic specialists hired to investigate the security incident determined that unauthorized actors had gained access to the DMG network between July 12, 2021, and July 13, 2021, and that it was they who had caused the outage.

In a statement published Monday, DMG said: ""With the assis­tance of the forensic specialists, DMG conducted a thorough and time-consuming review of its systems to under­stand whether any patient information may have been impacted as a result of this event.

""On August 17, 2021, we determined that certain files stored within our environment that contained patient information may have been impacted by this incident.""

The group said that the exposed data did not include any financial account numbers and that the investigation found no evidence of data misuse following the attack.

Since being targeted by hackers, DMG has implemented additional cybersecurity mea­sures and says it is reviewing existing security policies ""to further protect against future inci­dents and improve our technol­ogy roadmap to better serve patients.""

DMG is offering free credit monitoring and identity theft protection to those individuals affected and potentially affected by this incident.

The group has also established a dedicated call center to field questions from concerned patients regarding the possible data breach.

Patients are advised to remain vigilant against fraud and identity theft and to review their account statements, credit reports, and explanation of benefits forms for suspicious activity."

Currently, in the UK, video streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ are not subject to Ofcom’s Broadcasting Code, which sets out standards for content, including harmful or offensive material, accuracy, fairness and privacy.
This means that viewers of VoD content are much more likely to be exposed to harmful content, such as pseudoscience documentaries or misleading health advice.

“It is right that now we have left the EU, we look at introducing proportionate new rules so that UK audiences are protected from harm.”","The UK government is considering introducing new regulations for video-on-demand (VoD) services to protect users from harmful material such as misinformation.

The Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) has launched a consultation on the new provisions to level the regulatory playing field between mainstream VoD services and traditional broadcasters in the UK, like the BBC and Sky.

Currently, in the UK, video streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ are not subject to Ofcom’s Broadcasting Code, which sets out standards for content, including harmful or offensive material, accuracy, fairness and privacy. This means that viewers of VoD content are much more likely to be exposed to harmful content, such as pseudoscience documentaries or misleading health advice.

The government’s plans have come amid a surge in popularity for on-demand services in recent years, exacerbated during the COVID-19 lockdowns. Ofcom data has shown that 75% of UK households have used a subscription VoD service as of this year.

The UK’s departure from the EU means that the government is free to go beyond minimum standards set out in the revised Audiovisual Media Services Directive. This legislation governs EU-wide coordination of national legislation on all audiovisual media.

As part of the consultation, the DCMS is asking whether UK audiences watching TV-like VoD programs would like a similar level of protection to when they are watching traditional TV. Additionally, it wants to ensure that any regulatory change is proportionate and does not curtail essential protections such as freedom of speech.

Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden commented: “We want to give UK audiences peace of mind that however they watch TV in the digital age, the shows they enjoy are held to the same high standards that British broadcasting is world-renowned for.

“It is right that now we have left the EU, we look at introducing proportionate new rules so that UK audiences are protected from harm.”"

Security testing site Comparitech analyzed the 77 attacks reported by educational institutions nationwide in 2020 and calculated the cost to these victims from estimated downtime and recovery time.

Rransom costs are difficult to gauge given most schools kept their payments secret. However, the research team was able to work out average downtime (seven days) and recovery time (55.4 days) from roughly half of all incidents.

It then applied a third-party 2017 estimate for the cost of downtime averaged across 20 sectors.

While the eventual figure of $6.6bn for total downtime cost in 2020 is speculative, it can be used to provide interesting comparisons with 2019 ($8.2bn) and 2018 ($623.7m).

Comparitech claimed that 2020 saw 1,740 schools and colleges and potentially 1.4m students affected, an increase of 39% and 67% respectively on 2019 figures. This is despite the actual number of attacks in 2020 coming in 20% lower than the figure for the previous year.

“This suggests hackers targeted larger school districts with bigger annual budgets, hoping to cause greater disruption and increase their ransom payment demands,” Comparitech argued.

“This trend looks as though it has continued in 2021, too, exemplified by the bizarre $40 million ransom request made to Broward County Public Schools in April.”

Ransom demands in 2020 varied dramatically from just $10,000 to over $1m, although the researchers were only able to find mention of these for nine out of the 77 attacks it analyzed.

From January 2018 to June 2021, Comparitech logged 222 separate ransomware attacks on US schools and colleges, impacting 3,880 schools and nearly three million students.

Downtime alone is estimated to have cost these victim organizations over $17.3bn, with recovery costs adding millions, if not billions, to the total, it said."

This figure was mainly comprised of penalties imposed by the UK’s data protection watchdog for two high-profile data breaches that resulted in millions of people's personal data being compromised. In October 2020, a £20m fine was issued to British Airways for security failings that enabled a cyber-attack to take place in 2018, leading to personal data of 429,612 customers and staff being accessed. In the other case, in October 2020, hotel chain Marriott International was fined £18.4m by the ICO over a data breach that saw an estimated 339 million guest records exposed globally.

Both of these fines were significantly lower from the figures originally proposed by the ICO, with the body taking into account the economic damage of COVID-19 on these businesses.

In addition to these blockbuster fines for data breaches, there was also a four-fold rise in the number of fines related to nuisance messaging and cold calling issued by the ICO in 2020/21 compared to the previous year.

Richard Breavington, partner at RPC, commented: “Clearly, the ICO will impose blockbuster fines when it wants large organizations to sit up and take notice. However, overall the ICO has been very fair in terms of the levels of fines it has set.

“The overall number of fines arising from cyber-breaches has remained fairly consistent despite a sharp jump in the number of actual cyber-attacks.

“At the outset of the GDPR regime, there was the concern that the ICO would be making full use of its powers to fine, but so far, it seems to only be fining as a last resort.

“The two large fines could have been even higher, but the ICO appears to have taken into account the devastating impact of coronavirus on the travel and hospitality sectors and reduced them. However, businesses shouldn’t become complacent.”

Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the maximum fine the ICO can issue is £17.5m or 4% of a company’s total worldwide annual turnover, whichever is higher."

But the severity of the vulnerability was apparent to Wiz chief technology officer Ami Luttwak. The former CTO at Microsoft's Cloud Security Group said: “This is the worst cloud vulnerability you can imagine. It is a long-lasting secret. This is the central database of Azure, and we were able to get access to any customer database that we wanted.”

In a blog post dedicated to the discovery, Wiz stated that its researchers ""were able to gain complete unrestricted access to the accounts and databases of several thousand Microsoft Azure customers, including many Fortune 500 companies.""

Luttwak warned that the flaw, which was found lurking in a visualization tool called Jupyter Notebook, may have impacted additional Microsoft customers who have not been notified, since the company only emailed customers whose keys were visible in August.

Camille Charaudeau, vice president of product strategy at CybelAngel, commented that the flaw met all the conditions for ""a proper ransomware attack."""

After several years of working with investigators, Schober says he’s confident he has located two young men in the United Kingdom responsible for using a clever piece of digital clipboard-stealing malware to siphon his crypto holdings. Schober is now suing each of their parents in a civil case that seeks to extract what their children would not return voluntarily.

In a lawsuit filed in Colorado, Schober said the sudden disappearance of his funds in January 2018 prompted him to spend more than $10,000 hiring experts in the field of tracing cryptocurrency transactions. After months of sleuthing, his investigators identified the likely culprits: Two young men in Britain who were both minors at the time of the crime (both are currently studying computer science at U.K. universities).

A forensic investigation of Schober’s computer found he’d inadvertently downloaded malicious software after clicking a link posted on Reddit for a purported cryptocurrency wallet application called “Electrum Atom.” Investigators determined that the malware was bundled with the benign program, and was designed to lie in wait for users to copy a cryptocurrency address to their computer’s temporary clipboard.

When Schober went to move approximately 16.4 bitcoins from one account to another — by pasting the lengthy payment address he’d just copied — the malware replaced his bitcoin payment address with a different address controlled by the young men.

Schober’s lawsuit lays out how his investigators traced the stolen funds through cryptocurrency exchanges and on to the two youths in the United Kingdom. In addition, they found one of the defendants — just hours after Schober’s bitcoin was stolen — had posted a message to GitHub asking for help accessing the private key corresponding to the public key of the bitcoin address used by the clipboard-stealing malware.

Investigators found the other defendant had the malware code that was bundled with the Electrum Atom application in his Github code library.

Initially, Schober hoped that the parents of the thieving teens would listen to reason, and simply return the money. So he wrote a letter to the parents of both boys:

“It seems your son has been using malware to steal money from people online,” reads the opening paragraph of the letter Schober emailed to the families. “Losing that money has been financially and emotionally devastating. He might have thought he was playing a harmless joke, but it has had serious consequences for my life.”

Met with continued silence from the parents for many months, Schober filed suit against the kids and their parents in a Colorado court. A copy of the May 2021 complaint is here (PDF).

Now they are responding. One of the defendants —Hazel D. Wells — just filed a motion with the court to represent herself and her son in lieu of hiring an attorney. In a filing on Aug. 9, Wells helpfully included the letter in the screenshot above, and volunteered that her son had been questioned by U.K. authorities in connection with the bitcoin theft.

Neither of the defendants’ families are disputing the basic claim that their kids stole from Mr. Schober. Rather, they’re asserting that time has run out on Schober’s legal ability to claim a cause of action against them.

“Plaintiff alleges two common law causes of action (conversion and trespass to chattel), for which a three-year statute of limitations applies,” an attorney for the defendants argued in a filing on Aug. 6 (PDF). “Plaintiff further alleges a federal statutory cause of action, for which a two-year statute of limitations applies. Because plaintiff did not file his lawsuit until May 21, 2021, three years and five months after his injury, his claims should be dismissed.”

Schober’s attorneys argue (PDF) that “the statute of limitations begins to run when the Plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the existence and cause of the injury which is the base of his action,” and that inherent in this concept is the discovery rule, namely: That the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the plaintiff knows or has reason to know of both the existence and cause of his injury.

The plaintiffs point out that Schober’s investigators didn’t pinpoint one of the young men’s involvement until more than a year after they’d identified his co-conspirator, saying Schober notified the second boy’s parents in December 2019.

None of the parties to this lawsuit responded to requests for comment.

Mark Rasch, a former prosecutor with the U.S. Justice Department, said the plaintiff is claiming the parents are liable because he gave them notice of a crime committed by their kids and they failed to respond.

“A lot of these crimes are being committed by juveniles, and we don’t have a good juvenile justice system that’s well designed to both civilly and criminally go after kids,” Rasch said.

Rasch said he’s currently an attorney in a number of lawsuits involving young men who’ve been accused of stealing and laundering millions of dollars of cryptocurrency — specifically crimes involving SIM swapping — where the fraudsters trick or bribe an employee at a mobile phone store into transferring control of a target’s phone number to a device they control.

In those cases, the plaintiffs have sought to extract compensation for their losses from the mobile phone companies — but so far those lawsuits have largely failed to yield results and are often pushed into arbitration.

Rasch said it makes sense that some victims of cryptocurrency theft are spending some serious coin to track down their assailants and sue them civilly. But he said the legwork needed to make that case is tremendous and costly, and there’s no guarantee those investments will pay off down the road.

“These crimes can be monumentally difficult and expensive to track down,” he said. “It’s designed to be difficult to do, but it’s also not designed to be impossible to do.”

As evidenced by this week’s CNBC story on a marked rise in reports of people having their Coinbase accounts emptied by fraudsters, many people investing in cryptocurrencies find out the hard way that unlike traditional banking transactions — cryptocurrency funds lost to theft are likely to stay lost because the transactions are irreversible.

Traditionally, the major crypto exchanges have said they’re not responsible for lost or stolen funds. But perhaps in response to the CNBC story, Coinbase said it was introducing a new pilot “guarantee” for U.K. customers only, wherein they will be eligible for a reimbursement of up £150,000 if someone gains unauthorized access to their account and steals funds.

However, it seems unlikely Coinbase’s new guarantee would cover cases like Schober’s — even if he’d been a U.K. customer and the theft occurred today. One of the caveats that is not covered in the guarantee is sending funds to the wrong address by accident."

Apparently now that includes emailing employees directly and asking them to unleash the malware inside their employer’s network in exchange for a percentage of any ransom amount paid by the victim company.

Crane Hassold, director of threat intelligence at Abnormal Security, described what happened after he adopted a fake persona and responded to the proposal in the screenshot above. It offered to pay him 40 percent of a million-dollar ransom demand if he agreed to launch their malware inside his employer’s network.

This particular scammer was fairly chatty, and over the course of five days it emerged that Hassold’s correspondent was forced to change up his initial approach in planning to deploy the DemonWare ransomware strain, which is freely available on GitHub.

“According to this actor, he had originally intended to send his targets—all senior-level executives—phishing emails to compromise their accounts, but after that was unsuccessful, he pivoted to this ransomware pretext,” Hassold wrote.

Abnormal Security documented how it tied the email back to a young man in Nigeria who acknowledged he was trying to save up money to help fund a new social network he is building called Sociogram.

Reached via LinkedIn, Sociogram founder Oluwaseun Medayedupin asked to have his startup’s name removed from the story, although he did not respond to questions about whether there were an inaccuracies in Hassold’s report.

“Please don’t harm Sociogram’s reputation,” Medayedupin pleaded. “I beg you as a promising young man.”

This attacker’s approach may seem fairly amateur, but it would be a mistake to dismiss the threat from West African cybercriminals dabbling in ransomware. While multi-million dollar ransomware payments are hogging the headlines, by far the biggest financial losses tied to cybercrime each year stem from so-called Business Email Compromise (BEC) or CEO Scams, in which crooks mainly based in Africa and Southeast Asia will spoof communications from executives at the target firm in a bid to initiate unauthorized international wire transfers.

According to the latest figures (PDF) released by the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), the reported losses from BEC scams continue to dwarf other cybercrime loss categories, increasing to $1.86 billion in 2020.

“Knowing the actor is Nigerian really brings the entire story full circle and provides some notable context to the tactics used in the initial email we identified,” Hassold wrote. “For decades, West African scammers, primarily located in Nigeria, have perfected the use of social engineering in cybercrime activity.”

“While the most common cyber attack we see from Nigerian actors (and most damaging attack globally) is business email compromise (BEC), it makes sense that a Nigerian actor would fall back on using similar social engineering techniques, even when attempting to successfully deploy a more technically sophisticated attack like ransomware,” Hassold concluded.

DON’T QUIT YOUR DAY JOB

Cybercriminals trolling for disgruntled employees is hardly a new development. Big companies have long been worried about the very real threat of disgruntled employees creating identities on darknet sites and then offering to trash their employer’s network for a fee (for more on that, see my 2016 story, Rise of the Darknet Stokes Fear of the Insider).

Indeed, perhaps this enterprising Nigerian scammer is just keeping up with current trends. Several established ransomware affiliate gangs that have recently rebranded under new banners seem to have done away with the affiliate model in favor of just buying illicit access to corporate networks.

For example, the Lockbit 2.0 ransomware-as-a-service gang actually includes a solicitation for insiders in the desktop wallpaper left behind on systems encrypted with the malware.

“Would you like to earn millions of dollars? Our company acquires access to networks of various companies, as well as insider information that can help you steal the most valuable data of any company,” LockBit’s unusual ad reads. “You can provide us accounting data for the access to any company, for example, login and password to RDP, VPN, corporate email, etc. Open our letter at your email. Launch the provided virus on any computer in your company. Companies pay us the foreclosure for the decryption of files and prevention of data leak.”

Likewise, the newly formed BlackMatter ransomware gang kicked off its presence on the cybercrime forums with the unassuming thread, “Buying/monetizing your access to corporate networks.” The rest of the post reads:"

No Metro by T-Mobile, former Sprint prepaid, or Boost customers had their names or PINs exposed,” T-Mobile said.
But regardless of which mobile provider you patronize, consider removing your phone number from as many online accounts as you can.","T-Mobile is warning that a data breach has exposed the names, date of birth, Social Security number and driver’s license/ID information of more than 40 million current, former or prospective customers who applied for credit with the company. The acknowledgment came less than 48 hours after millions of the stolen T-Mobile customer records went up for sale in the cybercrime underground.

In a statement Tuesday evening, T-Mobile said a “highly sophisticated” attack against its network led to the breach of data on millions of customers.

“Our preliminary analysis is that approximately 7.8 million current T-Mobile postpaid customer accounts’ information appears to be contained in the stolen files, as well as just over 40 million records of former or prospective customers who had previously applied for credit with T-Mobile,” the company wrote in a blog post. “Importantly, no phone numbers, account numbers, PINs, passwords, or financial information were compromised in any of these files of customers or prospective customers.”

Nevertheless, T-Mobile is urging all T-Mobile postpaid customers to proactively change their account PINs by going online into their T-Mobile account or calling customer care at 611. “This precaution is despite the fact that we have no knowledge that any postpaid account PINs were compromised,” the advisory reads.

It is not clear how many people total may be impacted by this breach. T-Mobile hasn’t yet responded to requests for clarification regarding how many of the 7.8 million current customers may also have been affected by the credit application breach.

The intrusion first came to light on Twitter when the account @und0xxed started tweeting the details, and someone on a cybercrime forum began selling what they claimed were more than 100 million freshly hacked records from T-Mobile. The hackers claimed one of those databases held the name, date of birth, SSN, drivers license information, plaintext security PIN, address and phone number of 36 million T-Mobile customers in the United States — all going back to the mid-1990s.

T-Mobile said it was also able to confirm approximately 850,000 active T-Mobile prepaid customer names, phone numbers and account PINs were also exposed.

“We have already proactively reset ALL of the PINs on these accounts to help protect these customers, and we will be notifying accordingly right away. No Metro by T-Mobile, former Sprint prepaid, or Boost customers had their names or PINs exposed,” T-Mobile said. “We have also confirmed that there was some additional information from inactive prepaid accounts accessed through prepaid billing files. No customer financial information, credit card information, debit or other payment information or SSN was in this inactive file.”

T-Mobile said it would pay for two years of identity theft protection services for any affected customers, and that it was offering “an extra step to protect your mobile account with our Account Takeover Protection capabilities for postpaid customers, which makes it harder for customer accounts to be fraudulently ported out and stolen.” Why it wouldn’t make that extra protection standard for all accounts all the time is not entirely clear.

This stolen data is being actively sold, but if the past is any teacher much of it will wind up posted online soon. It is a safe bet that scammers will use some of this information to target T-Mobile users with phishing messages, account takeovers and harassment.

T-Mobile customers should expect to see phishers taking advantage of public concern over the breach to impersonate the company — and possibly even messages that include the recipient’s compromised account details to make the communications look more legitimate.

Data stolen and exposed in this breach may also be used for identity theft. Credit monitoring and ID theft protection services can help you recover from having your identity stolen, but most will do nothing to stop the ID theft from happening. If you want the maximum control over who should be able to view your credit or grant new lines of credit in your name, then a security freeze is your best option.

If you’re a current T-Mobile customer, by all means change your account PIN as instructed. But regardless of which mobile provider you patronize, consider removing your phone number from as many online accounts as you can. Many online services require you to provide a phone number upon registering an account, but in many cases that number can be removed from your profile afterwards.

Why do I suggest this? Many online services allow users to reset their passwords just by clicking a link sent via SMS, and this unfortunately widespread practice has turned mobile phone numbers into de facto identity documents. Which means losing control over your phone number thanks to an unauthorized SIM swap or mobile number port-out, divorce, job termination or financial crisis can be devastating."

On Sunday, Vice.com broke the news that someone was selling data on 100 million people, and that the data came from T-Mobile. In a statement published on its website today, the company confirmed it had suffered an intrusion involving “some T-Mobile data,” but said it was too soon in its investigation to know what was stolen and how many customers might be affected.

“We have determined that unauthorized access to some T-Mobile data occurred, however we have not yet determined that there is any personal customer data involved,” T-Mobile wrote.

“We are confident that the entry point used to gain access has been closed, and we are continuing our deep technical review of the situation across our systems to identify the nature of any data that was illegally accessed,” the statement continued. “This investigation will take some time but we are working with the highest degree of urgency. Until we have completed this assessment we cannot confirm the reported number of records affected or the validity of statements made by others.”

The intrusion came to light on Twitter when the account @und0xxed started tweeting the details. Reached via direct message, Und0xxed said they were not involved in stealing the databases but was instead in charge of finding buyers for the stolen T-Mobile customer data.

Und0xxed said the hackers found an opening in T-Mobile’s wireless data network that allowed access to two of T-Mobile’s customer data centers. From there, the intruders were able to dump a number of customer databases totaling more than 100 gigabytes.

They claim one of those databases holds the name, date of birth, SSN, drivers license information, plaintext security PIN, address and phone number of 36 million T-Mobile customers in the United States — all going back to the mid-1990s.

The hacker(s) claim the purloined data also includes IMSI and IMEI data for 36 million customers. These are unique numbers embedded in customer mobile devices that identify the device and the SIM card that ties that customer’s device to a telephone number.

“If you want to verify that I have access to the data/the data is real, just give me a T-Mobile number and I’ll run a lookup for you and return the IMEI and IMSI of the phone currently attached to the number and any other details,” @und0xxed said. “All T-Mobile USA prepaid and postpaid customers are affected; Sprint and the other telecoms that T-Mobile owns are unaffected.”

Other databases allegedly accessed by the intruders included one for prepaid accounts, which had far fewer details about customers.

“Prepaid customers usually are just phone number and IMEI and IMSI,” Und0xxed said. “Also, the collection of databases includes historical entries, and many phone numbers have 10 or 20 IMEIs attached to them over the years, and the service dates are provided. There’s also a database that includes credit card numbers with six digits of the cards obfuscated.”

T-Mobile declined to comment beyond what the company said in its blog post today.

In 2015, a computer breach at big three credit bureau Experian exposed the Social Security numbers and other data on 15 million people who applied for financing from T-Mobile.

Like other mobile providers, T-Mobile is locked in a constant battle with scammers who target its own employees in SIM swapping attacks and other techniques to wrest control over employee accounts that can provide backdoor access to customer data. In at least one case, retail store employees were complicit in the account takeovers.

WHO HACKED T-MOBILE?

The Twitter profile for the account @Und0xxed includes a shout out to @IntelSecrets, the Twitter account of a fairly elusive hacker who also has gone by the handles IRDev and V0rtex. Asked if @IntelSecrets was involved in the T-Mobile intrusion, @und0xxed confirmed that it was.

The IntelSecrets nicknames correspond to an individual who has claimed responsibility for modifying the source code for the Mirai “Internet of Things” botnet to create a variant known as “Satori,” and supplying it to others who used it for criminal gain and were later caught and prosecuted. Like Kenny “NexusZeta” Schuchmann, who pleaded guilty in 2019 to operating the Satori botnet. Two other young men have been charged in connection with Satori — but not IntelSecrets.

How do we know all this about IntelSecrets/IRDev/V0rtex? That identity has acknowledged as much in a series of bizarre lawsuits filed by a person who claims their real name is John Erin Binns. The same Binns identity operates the website intelsecrets[.]su.

On that site, Binns claims he fled to Germany and Turkey to evade prosecution in the Satori case, only to be kidnapped in Turkey and subjected to various forms of psychological and physical torture. According to Binns, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) falsely told their counterparts in Turkey that he was a supporter or member of the Islamic State (ISIS), a claim he says led to his alleged capture and torture by the Turks.

Since then, Binns has filed a flood of lawsuits naming various federal agencies — including the FBI, the CIA, and the U.S. Special Operations Command (PDF), demanding that the government turn over information collected about him and seeking restitution for his alleged kidnapping at the hands of the CIA.

Speaking to the researcher Alon Gal (@underthebreach), the hackers responsible for the T-Mobile intrusion said they did it to “retaliate against the US for the kidnapping and torture of John Erin Binns in Germany by the CIA and Turkish intelligence agents in 2019. We did it to harm US infrastructure.”

Update, Aug. 18, 9:15 a.m. ET: In a blog post Monday evening, T-Mobile acknowledged that a data breach has exposed the names, date of birth, Social Security number and driver’s license/ID information of more than 40 million current, former or prospective customers."

Dubbed “Antinalysis,” the service purports to offer a glimpse into how one’s payment activity might be flagged by law enforcement agencies and private companies that try to link suspicious cryptocurrency transactions to real people.

“Worried about dirty funds in your BTC address? Come check out Antinalysis, the new address risk analyzer,” reads the service’s announcement, pointing to a link only accessible via Tor. “This service is dedicated to individuals that have the need to possess complete privacy on the blockchain, offering a perspective from the opponent’s point of view in order for the user to comprehend the possibility of his/her funds getting flagged down under autocratic illegal charges.”

The ad continues:

Some people might ask, why go into all that? Just cash out in XMR and be done with it. The problem is, cashing out in Monero raises eyebrows on exchanges and mail by cash method is sometimes risky as well. If you use BTC->XMR->BTC method, you’ll still get flagged down by our services labelled as high risk exchange (not to mention LE and exchanges). Our service provides you with a view from LE/exchange’s perspective of things (with similar accuracy, but quite different approach) that provides you with basic knowledge of how “clean” your address is.”

Tom Robinson, co-founder of blockchain intelligence firm Elliptic, said Antinalysis is designed to help crypto money launderers test whether their funds will be identified as proceeds of crime by regulated financial exchanges.

“Cryptoassets have become an important tool for cybercriminals,” Robinson wrote. “The likes of ransomware and darknet markets rely on payments being made in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, laundering and cashing-out these proceeds is a major challenge.”

Cryptocurrency exchanges make use of blockchain analytics tools, he said, to check customer deposits for links to illicit activity. By tracing a transaction back through the blockchain, these tools can identify whether the funds originated from a wallet associated with ransomware or any other criminal activity.

“The launderer therefore risks being identified as a criminal and being reported to law enforcement whenever they send funds to a business using such a tool,” Robinson said. “Antinalysis seeks to help crypto launderers to avoid this, by giving them a preview of what a blockchain analytics tool will make of their bitcoin wallet and the funds it contains.”

Each lookup at Antinalysis costs roughly USD $3, with a minimum $30 purchase. Other plans go as high as $6,000 for 5,000 requests.

Robinson says the creator of Antinalysis is also one of the developers of Incognito Market, a darknet marketplace specializing in the sale of narcotics.

“Incognito was launched in late 2020, and accepts payments in both Bitcoin and Monero, a cryptoasset offering heightened anonymity,” he wrote. “The launch of Antinalysis likely reflects the difficulties faced by the market and its vendors in cashing out their Bitcoin proceeds.”

Elliptic wasn’t impressed with the quality of the intelligence provided by Antinalysis, saying it performs poorly on detecting links to major darknet markets and other criminal entities. But with countless criminals now making millions from ransomware, there is certainly a vast, untapped market for services that help those folks improve their operational security.

“It is also significant because it makes blockchain analytics available to the public for the first time,” Robinson wrote. “To date, this type of analysis has been used primarily by regulated financial service providers.”

That may not be entirely true. Nick Bax is an independent expert in tracing cryptocurrency transactions, and he said it appears Antinalysis may be little more than a clone of AMLBot, an anti- anti-money laundering intelligence service that first came online in 2019.

“It looks almost identical to the cheap version of AMLBot,” Bax told KrebsOnSecurity. “My guess is they’re just white-labeling that.”

Bax said a lookup at AMLBot on the virtual currency address used in the sample provided by Antinalysis shows a near identical result. Here’s AMLBot’s result for the same crypto analysis performed by Antinalysis in the screenshot at the top of this story:

“If you look at the breakdown the percentages are all almost identical,” Bax said. “I use AMLBot occasionally for good and righteous purposes. And it could also be useful for people who are just selling stuff online to make sure they aren’t receiving tainted funds.”

Update, 1:42 p.m. ET: Corrected the story to note that AMLBot has been around since 2019.

Update, 1:52 p.m. ET: Elliptic updated its blog post to confirm the connection between Antinanlysis and AMLBot, noting that AMLBot itself is a reseller of yet another service: “As first suggested in an article by Brian Krebs, we can now confirm that the results provided by Antinalysis are identical to those provided by AMLBot. It is therefore likely that Antinalysis makes use of the AMLBot API. AMLBot is itself a reseller for Crystal Blockchain, an analytics provider.”"

The software giant warned that attackers already are pouncing on one of the flaws, which ironically enough involves an easy-to-exploit bug in the software component responsible for patching Windows 10 PCs and Windows Server 2019 machines.

Microsoft said attackers have seized upon CVE-2021-36948, which is a weakness in the Windows Update Medic service. Update Medic is a new service that lets users repair Windows Update components from a damaged state so that the device can continue to receive updates.

Redmond says while CVE-2021-36948 is being actively exploited, it is not aware of exploit code publicly available. The flaw is an “elevation of privilege” vulnerability that affects Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019, meaning it can be leveraged in combination with another vulnerability to let attackers run code of their choice as administrator on a vulnerable system.

“CVE-2021-36948 is a privilege escalation vulnerability – the cornerstone of modern intrusions as they allow attackers the level of access to do things like hide their tracks and create user accounts,” said Kevin Breen of Immersive Labs. “In the case of ransomware attacks, they have also been used to ensure maximum damage.”

According to Microsoft, critical flaws are those that can be exploited remotely by malware or malcontents to take complete control over a vulnerable Windows computer — and with little to no help from users. Top of the heap again this month: Microsoft also took another stab at fixing a broad class of weaknesses in its printing software.

Last month, the company rushed out an emergency update to patch “PrintNightmare” — a critical hole in its Windows Print Spooler software that was being attacked in the wild. Since then, a number of researchers have discovered holes in that patch, allowing them to circumvent its protections.

Today’s Patch Tuesday fixes another critical Print Spooler flaw (CVE-2021-36936), but it’s not clear if this bug is a variant of PrintNightmare or a unique vulnerability all on its own, said Dustin Childs at Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative.

“Microsoft does state low privileges are required, so that should put this in the non-wormable category, but you should still prioritize testing and deployment of this Critical-rated bug,” Childs said.

Microsoft said the Print Spooler patch it is pushing today should address all publicly documented security problems with the service.

“Today we are addressing this risk by changing the default Point and Print driver installation and update behavior to require administrator privileges,” Microsoft said in a blog post. “This change may impact Windows print clients in scenarios where non-elevated users were previously able to add or update printers. However, we strongly believe that the security risk justifies the change. This change will take effect with the installation of the security updates released on August 10, 2021 for all versions of Windows, and is documented as CVE-2021-34481.”

August brings yet another critical patch (CVE-2021-34535) for the Windows Remote Desktop service, and this time the flaw is in the Remote Desktop client instead of the server.

CVE-2021-26424 — a scary, critical bug in the Windows TCP/IP component — earned a CVSS score of 9.9 (10 is the worst), and is present in Windows 7 through Windows 10, and Windows Server 2008 through 2019 (Windows 7 is no longer being supported with security updates).

Microsoft said it was not aware of anyone exploiting this bug yet, although the company assigned it the label “exploitation more likely,” meaning it may not be difficult for attackers to figure out. CVE-2021-26424 could be exploited by sending a single malicious data packet to a vulnerable system.

For a complete rundown of all patches released today and indexed by severity, check out the always-useful Patch Tuesday roundup from the SANS Internet Storm Center. And it’s not a bad idea to hold off updating for a few days until Microsoft works out any kinks in the updates: AskWoody.com usually has the lowdown on any patches that are causing problems for Windows users.

On that note, before you update please make sure you have backed up your system and/or important files. It’s not uncommon for a Windows update package to hose one’s system or prevent it from booting properly, and some updates have been known to erase or corrupt files.

So do yourself a favor and backup before installing any patches. Windows 10 even has some built-in tools to help you do that, either on a per-file/folder basis or by making a complete and bootable copy of your hard drive all at once.

And if you wish to ensure Windows has been set to pause updating so you can back up your files and/or system before the operating system decides to reboot and install patches on its own schedule, see this guide.

If you experience glitches or problems installing any of these patches this month, please consider leaving a comment about it below; there’s a decent chance other readers have experienced the same and may chime in here with useful tips."

“Hello I go by the username Nuclear27 on your site Briansclub[.]com,” wrote “Mitch,” confusing me with the proprietor of perhaps the underground’s largest bazaar for stolen credit and identity data. “I made a deposit to my wallet on the site but nothing has shown up yet and I would like to know why.”

Several things stood out in Mitch’s message. For starters, that is not the actual domain for BriansClub. And it’s easy to see why Mitch got snookered: The real BriansClub site is currently not at the top of search results when one queries that shop name at Google.

Also, this greenhorn criminal clearly had bought into BriansClub’s advertising, which uses my name and likeness in a series of ads that run on all the top cybercrime forums. In those ads, a crab with my head on it zigs and zags on the sand. This is all meant to be a big joke: Krebs means “crab” or “cancer” in German, but a “crab” is sometimes used in Russian hacker slang to refer to a “carder,” or a person who regularly engages in street-level credit card fraud. Like Mitch.

In late 2019, BriansClub changed its homepage to include doctored images of my Social Security and passport cards, credit report and mobile phone bill information. That was right after KrebsOnSecurity broke the news that someone had hacked BriansClub and siphoned information on 26 million stolen debit and credit accounts. The hacked BriansClub database had an estimated collective street value of $566 million, and that data was subsequently shared with thousands of financial institutions.

Mitch said he’d just made a deposit of $240 worth of bitcoin at BriansClub[.]com, and was wondering when the funds would be reflected in the balance of his account on the shop.

Playing along, I said I was sorry to hear about his ordeal, and asked Mitch if there were any stolen cards issued by a particular bank or to a specific region that he was seeking.

Mitch didn’t bite, but neither would he be dissuaded that I was at fault for his wayward funds. He shared a picture showing funds he’d sent to the bitcoin address instructed by BriansClub[.]com — 1PLALmM5rrmLTGGVRHHTnB6VnZd3FFwh1Z — using a Bitcoin ATM in Canada.

The real BriansClub uses a dodgy virtual currency exchange service based in St. Petersburg, Russia called PinPays. The company’s website has long featured little more than a brand icon and an instant messenger address to reach the proprietor. The fake BriansClub told Mitch the Bitcoin address he was asked to pay was a PinPays address that would change with each transaction.

However, upon registering at the phishing site and clicking to fund my account, I was presented with the exact same Bitcoin address that Mitch said he paid. Also, the site wasn’t using PinPays; it was just claiming to do so to further mimic the real BriansClub.

According to the Blockchain, that Bitcoin address Mitch paid has received more than a thousand payments over the past five months totaling more than USD $40,000 worth of Bitcoin. Most are relatively small payments like Mitch’s.

Unwary scammers like Mitch are a dime a dozen, as are phishing sites that spoof criminal services online. Shortly after it came online as a phishing site last year, BriansClub[.]com was hosted at a company in Moscow with just a handful of other domains phishing popular cybercrime stores, including Jstashbazar[.]com, vclub[.]cards, vclubb[.]com and vclub[.]credit.

Whoever’s behind these sites is making a decent income fleecing clueless crooks. A review of the Bitcoin wallet listed as the payment address for BriansClub[.]org, for example, shows a similar haul: 704 transactions totaling $38,000 in Bitcoin over the past 10 months.

“Wow, thanks for ripping me off,” Mitch wrote, after I’d dozed off for the evening without responding to his increasingly strident emails. “Should have spent the last money on my bills I’m trying to pay off. Should have known you were nothing but a thief.”

Deciding the ruse had gone too far, I confessed to Mitch that I wasn’t really the administrator of BriansClub, and that the person he’d reached out to was an independent journalist who writes about cybercrime. I told him not to feel bad, as more than a thousand people had been similarly duped by the carding shop.

But Mitch did not appear to accept my confession.

“If that’s the case then why is your name all over it including in the window that opens up when you go to make a deposit?,” Mitch demanded, referring to the phishing site.

Clearly, nothing I said was going to deter Mitch at this point. He asked in a follow-up email if a link he included in the message was indeed the “legitimate” BriansClub address. My only reply was that he should maybe consider another line of work before he got ripped off yet again, or the Royal Canadian Mounted Police showed up at his doorstep.

Scammers who fall for fake carding sites can expect to have their accounts taken over at the real shop, which usually means someone spends your balance on stolen cards. But mostly, these imposter carding sites are asking new members to fund their accounts by making deposits in virtual currency like Bitcoin.

In 2018, KrebsOnSecurity examined a huge network of phishing sites masquerading as the top carding stores which all traced back to a web development group in Pakistan that’s apparently been stealing from thieves for years.

As I noted in that piece, creating a network of fake carding sites is the perfect cybercrime. After all, nobody who gets phished or scammed is going to report the crime to the authorities. Nor will anyone help the poor sucker who gets snookered by one of these fake carding sites. Caveat Emptor!

The most one can hope for is that the occasional enterprising phisher is brought to justice. While it may be hard to believe that authorities would go after crooks stealing from one another, in 2017 a Connecticut man pleaded guilty to charges of phishing several criminal dark web markets in a scheme that eventually netted over $365,000 and more than 10,000 stolen user credentials.

And what about the provenance of the phishing domain briansclub[.]com? Looking closer at the original WHOIS registration records for briansclub[.]com via DomainTools (an advertiser on this site), we can see it was registered in November 2015 — several months after the real BriansClub came online. It was registered to a “Brian Billionaire,” a.k.a. Brian O’Connor, an apparently accomplished music deejay, rapper and rap music producer in Florida.

For several years after it came online, BriansClub[.]com and other domains apparently registered to Mr. Billionaire redirected to his main site — newhotmusic.com, which predates the carding shop BriansClub and also has a members-only section of the site called Brian’s Club.

Mr. Billionaire did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but it looks like his only crime is being a somewhat cringeworthy DJ. DomainTools’ record for briansclub[.]com says the domain was abandoned or dormant for a period in 2019, only to be scooped up again by someone in May 2020 when it became a phishing site spoofing the real BriansClub."

I put together the above graphic to illustrate some of the more notable ransom gang reinventions over the past five years. What it doesn’t show is what we already know about the cybercriminals behind many of these seemingly disparate ransomware groups, some of whom were pioneers in the ransomware space almost a decade ago. We’ll explore that more in the latter half of this story.

One of the more intriguing and recent revamps involves DarkSide, the group that extracted a $5 million ransom from Colonial Pipeline earlier this year, only to watch much of it get clawed back in an operation by the U.S. Department of Justice.

After acknowledging someone had also seized their Internet servers, DarkSide announced it was folding. But a little more than a month later, a new ransomware affiliate program called BlackMatter emerged, and experts quickly determined BlackMatter was using the same unique encryption methods that DarkSide had used in their attacks.

DarkSide’s demise roughly coincided with that of REvil, a long-running ransomware group that claims to have extorted more than $100 million from victims. REvil’s last big victim was Kaseya, a Miami-based company whose products help system administrators manage large networks remotely. That attack let REvil deploy ransomware to as many as 1,500 organizations that used Kaseya.

REvil demanded a whopping $70 million to release a universal decryptor for all victims of the Kaseya attack. Just days later, President Biden reportedly told Russian President Vladimir Putin that he expects Russia to act when the United States shares information on specific Russians involved in ransomware activity.

Whether that conversation prompted actions is unclear. But REvil’s victim shaming blog would disappear from the dark web just four days later.

Mark Arena, CEO of cyber threat intelligence firm Intel 471, said it remains unclear whether BlackMatter is the REvil crew operating under a new banner, or if it is simply the reincarnation of DarkSide.

But one thing is clear, Arena said: “Likely we will see them again unless they’ve been arrested.”

Likely, indeed. REvil is widely considered a reboot of GandCrab, a prolific ransomware gang that boasted of extorting more than $2 billion over 12 months before abruptly closing up shop in June 2019. “We are living proof that you can do evil and get off scot-free,” Gandcrab bragged.

And wouldn’t you know it: Researchers have found GandCrab shared key behaviors with Cerber, an early ransomware-as-a-service operation that stopped claiming new victims at roughly the same time that GandCrab came on the scene.

GOOD GRIEF

The past few months have been a busy time for ransomware groups looking to rebrand. BleepingComputer recently reported that the new “Grief” ransomware startup was just the latest paintjob of DoppelPaymer, a ransomware strain that shared most of its code with an earlier iteration from 2016 called BitPaymer.

All three of these ransom operations stem from a prolific cybercrime group known variously as TA505, “Indrik Spider” and (perhaps most memorably) Evil Corp. According to security firm CrowdStrike, Indrik Spider was formed in 2014 by former affiliates of the GameOver Zeus criminal network who internally referred to themselves as “The Business Club.”

The Business Club was a notorious Eastern European organized cybercrime gang accused of stealing more than $100 million from banks and businesses worldwide. In 2015, the FBI offered a standing $3 million bounty for information leading to the capture of the Business Club’s leader — Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev. By the time the FBI put a price on his head, Bogachev’s Zeus trojan and later variants had been infecting computers for nearly a decade.

Bogachev was way ahead of his colleagues in pursuing ransomware. His Gameover Zeus Botnet was a peer-to-peer crime machine that infected between 500,000 and a million Microsoft Windows computers. Throughout 2013 and 2014, PCs infected with Gameover were seeded with Cryptolocker, an early, much-copied ransomware strain allegedly authored by Bogachev himself.

CrowdStrike notes that shortly after the group’s inception, Indrik Spider developed their own custom malware known as Dridex, which has emerged as a major vector for deploying malware that lays the groundwork for ransomware attacks.

“Early versions of Dridex were primitive, but over the years the malware became increasingly professional and sophisticated,” CrowdStrike researchers wrote. “In fact, Dridex operations were significant throughout 2015 and 2016, making it one of the most prevalent eCrime malware families.”

That CrowdStrike report was from July 2019. In April 2021, security experts at Check Point Software found Dridex was still the most prevalent malware (for the second month running). Mainly distributed via well-crafted phishing emails — such as a recent campaign that spoofed QuickBooks — Dridex often serves as the attacker’s initial foothold in company-wide ransomware attacks, CheckPoint said.

REBRANDING TO AVOID SANCTIONS

Another ransomware family tied to Evil Corp. and the Dridex gang is WastedLocker, which is the latest name of a ransomware strain that has rebranded several times since 2019. That was when the Justice Department put a $5 million bounty on the head of Evil Corp., and the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) said it was prepared to impose hefty fines on anyone who paid a ransom to the cybercrime group.

In early June 2021, researchers discovered the Dridex gang was once again trying to morph in an effort to evade U.S. sanctions. The drama began when the Babuk ransomware group announced in May that they were starting a new platform for data leak extortion, which was intended to appeal to ransomware groups that didn’t already have a blog where they can publicly shame victims into paying by gradually releasing stolen data.

On June 1, Babuk changed the name of its leaks site to payload[dot]bin, and began leaking victim data. Since then, multiple security experts have spotted what they believe is another version of WastedLocker dressed up as payload.bin-branded ransomware.

“Looks like EvilCorp is trying to pass off as Babuk this time,” wrote Fabian Wosar, chief technology officer at security firm Emsisoft. “As Babuk releases their PayloadBin leak portal, EvilCorp rebrands WastedLocker once again as PayloadBin in an attempt to trick victims into violating OFAC regulations.”

Experts are quick to point out that many cybercriminals involved in ransomware activity are affiliates of more than one distinct ransomware-as-a-service operation. In addition, it is common for a large number of affiliates to migrate to competing ransomware groups when their existing sponsor suddenly gets shut down.

All of the above would seem to suggest that the success of any strategy for countering the ransomware epidemic hinges heavily on the ability to disrupt or apprehend a relatively small number of cybercriminals who appear to wear many disguises.

Perhaps that’s why the Biden Administration said last month it was offering a $10 million reward for information that leads to the arrest of the gangs behind the extortion schemes, and for new approaches that make it easier to trace and block cryptocurrency payments."

Our continued reliance on passwords for authentication has contributed to one toxic data spill or hack after another. One might even say passwords are the fossil fuels powering most IT modernization: They’re ubiquitous because they are cheap and easy to use, but that means they also come with significant trade-offs — such as polluting the Internet with weaponized data when they’re leaked or stolen en masse.

When a website’s user database gets compromised, that information invariably turns up on hacker forums. There, denizens with computer rigs that are built primarily for mining virtual currencies can set to work using those systems to crack passwords.

How successful this password cracking is depends a great deal on the length of one’s password and the type of password hashing algorithm the victim website uses to obfuscate user passwords. But a decent crypto-mining rig can quickly crack a majority of password hashes generated with MD5 (one of the weaker and more commonly-used password hashing algorithms).

“You hand that over to a person who used to mine Ethereum or Bitcoin, and if they have a large enough dictionary [of pre-computed hashes] then you can essentially break 60-70 percent of the hashed passwords in a day or two,” said Fabian Wosar, chief technology officer at security firm Emsisoft.

From there, the list of email addresses and corresponding cracked passwords will be run through various automated tools that can check how many email address and password pairs in a given leaked data set also work at other popular websites (and heaven help those who’ve re-used their email password elsewhere).

This sifting of databases for low-hanging fruit and password re-use most often yields less than a one percent success rate — and usually far less than one percent.

But even a hit rate below one percent can be a profitable haul for fraudsters, particularly when they’re password testing databases with millions of users. From there, the credentials are eventually used for fraud and resold in bulk to legally murky online services that index and resell access to breached data.

Much like WeLeakInfo and others operated before being shut down by law enforcement agencies, these services sell access to anyone who wants to search through billions of stolen credentials by email address, username, password, Internet address, and a variety of other typical database fields.

TARGETED PHISHING

So hopefully by this point it should be clear why re-using passwords is generally a bad idea. But the more insidious threat with hacked databases comes not from password re-use but from targeted phishing activity in the early days of a breach, when relatively few ne’er-do-wells have got their hands on a hot new hacked database.

Earlier this month, customers of the soccer jersey retailer classicfootballshirts.co.uk started receiving emails with a “cash back” offer. The messages addressed customers by name and referenced past order numbers and payment amounts tied to each account. The emails encouraged recipients to click a link to accept the cash back offer, and the link went to a look-alike domain that requested bank information.

“It soon became clear that customer data relating to historic orders had been compromised to conduct this attack,” Classicfootballshirts said in a statement about the incident.

Allison Nixon, chief research officer with New York City-based cyber intelligence firm Unit221B, recalled what happened in the weeks leading up to Dec. 22, 2020, when cryptocurrency wallet company Ledger acknowledged that someone had released the names, mailing addresses and phone numbers for 272,000 customers.

Nixon said she and her colleagues noticed in the preceding months a huge uptick in SIM-swapping attacks, a scheme in which fraudsters trick or bribe employees at wireless phone companies into redirecting the target’s text messages and phone calls to a device they control. From there, the attackers can reset the password for any online account that allows password resets via SMS.

“A week or two prior to that we were seeing a whole lot of SIM swapping activity,” Nixon said. “We knew the information was coming from some database but we couldn’t figure out what service they all had in common. After the Ledger database got leaked publicly, we started looking at the [SIM swapping] victims and found 100 percent of them were present in the Ledger database.”

In a statement about the breach, Ledger said the data was likely stolen in June 2020, meaning hackers had roughly six months to launch targeted attacks using extremely detailed information about customers.

“If you were to look [on cybercrime forums] at the past history of people posting about that Ledger database, you’d see people were selling it privately for months prior to that,” Nixon said. “It seems like this database was slowly percolating out wider and wider, until someone decided to remove a lot of its value by posting the whole thing publicly.”

Here are some tips to help avoid falling prey to incessant data breaches and increasingly sophisticated phishing schemes:

–Avoid clicking on links and attachments in email, even in messages that appear to be sent from someone you have heard from previously. And as the phishing examples above demonstrate, many of today’s phishing scams use elements from hacked databases to make their lures more convincing.

–Urgency should be a giant red flag. Most phishing scams invoke a temporal element that warns of negative consequences should you fail to respond or act quickly. Take a deep breath. If you’re unsure whether the message is legitimate, visit the site or service in question manually (ideally, using a browser bookmark so as to avoid potential typosquatting sites).

–Don’t re-use passwords. If you’re the kind of person who likes to use the same password across multiple sites, then you definitely need to be using a password manager. That’s because password managers handle the tedious task of creating and remembering unique, complex passwords on your behalf; all you need to do is remember a single, strong master password or passphrase. In essence, you effectively get to use the same password across all Web sites. Some of the more popular password managers include Dashlane, Keepass, LastPass and Roboform.

–Phone-based phishing uses hacked databases, too: A great many scams are perpetrated over the phone, leveraging personal and financial information gleaned from past data breaches to make them sound more believable. If you think you’d never fall for someone trying to scam you over the phone, check out this story about how a tech-savvy professional got taken for thousands of dollars by a fraudster masquerading as his credit union. Remember, When in Doubt: Hang Up, Look Up, & Call Back."

When the U.S. Justice Department last week announced O’Connor’s arrest and indictment, his alleged role in the Twitter compromise was well covered in the media.

But most of the coverage seems to have overlooked the far more sinister criminal charges in the indictment, which involve an underground scene wherein young men turn to extortion, sextortion, SIM swapping, death threats and physical attacks — all in a frenzied effort to seize control over social media accounts.

Skim the government’s indictment and you might overlook a footnote on Page 4 that says O’Connor is part of a group that had exactly zero reservations about using their playbook of harassment tactics against law enforcement agents who were already investigating their alleged crimes.

“O’Connor has potentially been linked to additional prior swatting incidents and possibly (although not confirmed and currently still under investigation) the swatting of a U.S. law enforcement officer,” the footnote reads.

Swatting involves making a false report to authorities in a target’s name with the intention of sending a heavily armed police force to that person’s address. It’s a potentially deadly hoax: Earlier this month, a Tennessee man was sentenced to 60 months in prison for setting in motion a swatting attack that led to the death of a 60-year-old grandfather.

As for the actual criminal charges, O’Connor faces ten counts, including conspiracy, computer intrusion, extortive communications, stalking and threatening communications.

FEMALE TARGETS

All of those come into play in the case of the Snapchat account of actor Bella Thorne, who was allegedly targeted by PlugwalkJoe and associates in June 2019.

Investigators say O’Connor was involved in a “SIM swap” against Thorne’s mobile phone number. Unauthorized SIM swapping is a scheme in which fraudsters trick or bribe employees at wireless phone companies into redirecting the target’s text messages and phone calls to a device they control. From there, the attackers can reset the password for any online account that allows password resets via SMS.

In this case, the SIM swap was done to wrest control over Thorne’s Snapchat account. Once inside, the attackers found nude photos of Thorne, which they then threatened to release unless she agreed to post on social media thanking the hackers using their online handles.

The intruders posted on Thorne’s Snapchat, “Will drop nudes if 5000 of you follow @PlugwalkJoe.” Thorne told the feds her phone lost service shortly before her account was hijacked. Investigators later found the same Internet address used to access Thorne’s Snapchat account also was used minutes later to access “@Joe” on Instagram, which O’Connor has claimed publicly.

On June 15, 2019, Thorne posted on Twitter that she’d been “threatened with my own nudes,” and posted screenshots of the text message with the individual who had extorted him/her. Thorne said she was releasing the photographs so that the individual would not be able to “take yet another thing from me.”

The indictment alleges O’Connor also swatted and cyberstalked a 16-year-old girl, sending her nude photos and threatening to rape and/or murder her and her family.

Social media personality Addison Rae had 55 million followers when her TikTok account got hacked last August. I noted on Twitter at the time that PlugWalkJoe had left his calling card yet again. The indictment alleges O’Connor also was involved in a SIM-swap against Rae’s mobile number.





BAD REACTION

Prosecutors believe that roughly a week after the Twitter hack O’Connor called in bomb threats and swatting attacks targeting a high school and an airport in California. They’re confident it was O’Connor making the swatting and bomb threat calls because his voice is on record in a call he made to federal investigators, as well as to an inmate arrested for SIM swapping.

Curiously left out of the media coverage of O’Connor’s alleged crimes is that PlugwalkJoe appears to have admitted in a phone call with the FBI to being part of a criminal conspiracy. In the days following the Twitter mass-hack, O’Connor was quoted in The New York Times denying any involvement in the Twitter bitcoin scam. “I don’t care,” O’Connor told The Times. “They can come arrest me. I would laugh at them. I haven’t done anything.”

Speaking with KrebsOnSecurity via Instagram instant message just days after the Twitter hack, O’Connor demanded that his name be kept out of future blog posts here. After he was told that couldn’t be promised, he mentioned that some people in his circle of friends had been known to hire others to deliver physical beatings on people they didn’t like. In nearly the same breath, O’Connor said he was open to talking to federal investigators and telling his side of the story.

According to the indictment, a week after the Twitter hack a man identifying himself as O’Connor called federal investigators in Northern California. Specifically, the call went to the REACT Task Force. REACT is a team of law enforcement officers and prosecutors based in Santa Clara, Calif. that is focused on catching criminal SIM swappers, and by this point REACT already had plenty of audio from phone calls traced back to O’Connor in which he allegedly participated in a SIM swapping or swatting attack.

“REACT began receiving tips in 2018 regarding illegal activity of an individual using the online moniker ‘PlugwalkJoe,’ purportedly identified as O’Connor from the United Kingdom,” the indictment states.

Prosecutors redacted the name of the law enforcement officer who allegedly was swatted by PlugwalkJoe, referring to him only as “C.T.,” a criminal investigator for the Santa Clara District Attorney and a REACT Task Force member.

FBI agents called O’Connor back at the number he left. O’Connor told the FBI that on the afternoon of July 15, 2020 he’d been in contact with other associates who were in communications with the alleged mastermind of the Twitter bitcoin scam. Those intermediaries worked directly with Graham Clark, then 17, who pleaded guilty to fraud charges last summer in connection with the Twitter hack and agreed to serve three years in prison followed by three years of probation.

The indictment says O’Connor told the feds he only wanted his friends to relay his desire for Clark to secure several different short Twitter usernames that belonged to other people, accounts that were to be later sold for a profit. The other associates who allegedly helped PlugwalkJoe interact with Clark also have since been charged in connection with the Twitter hack.

Wireless security protocols have improved, but product vendors continue to make implementation errors that allow a variety of attacks.

The evolution of wireless security could at best be described as trial and error. The initial standard that debuted in the late 1990s — Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) — had significant security problems, and the first two version of Wireless Protected Access, WPA and WPA2, both have been found to be vulnerable to a variety of other security issues.

The trials continue with a host of so-called fragmentation attacks, or FragAttacks, that abuse the aggregation and fragmentation to allow machine-in-the-middle attacks. Details of the vulnerabilities, which have been kept secret for nine months, were disclosed at the Black Hat USA briefings on Aug. 5.

The issues occur in the way that small network packets are combined for transport, known as aggregation, or the way that large network packets are split up to improve reliability, known as aggregation. Even devices using WPA3, the latest wireless security standard, can be vulnerable, Mathy Vanhoef, a postdoctoral researcher at New York University Abu Dhabi, said during his Black Hat presentation.

""The fragmentation and aggregation functionality of Wi-Fi were never considered security-essential, so no one really looked at them,"" he said, adding: ""This really shows that all implementations are vulnerable — even, surprisingly, those that don't support fragmentation and those that don't support aggregation.""

The vulnerabilities — which Vanhoef described as design flaws in the IEEE 802.11 standard, more commonly known as Wi-Fi — were described in a paper released in June. The issues allow a local attacker who has fooled a victim into connecting to an attacker-controlled server to then insert themselves into the Wi-Fi network as a machine in the middle.

Vanhoef characterized these as design flaws because the specific mitigations are optional and not required, a lesson for future implementers of the standard.

""We should adopt defenses early, even if the concerns are theoretic, because that, for example, would have prevented the aggregation design flaw,"" he said. In addition, testing the software should be part of the credentialing process for vendors' devices, he added. ""We should keep fuzzing devices; ... the Wi-Fi Alliance could fuzz devices while they are being certified.""

Vanhoef discovered three design flaws in the current Wi-Fi standard. The first, CVE-2020-24588, allows an attacker to abuse the way that Wi-Fi aggregates smaller data packets into larger frames to optimize wireless data rates. The researcher used the attack to send victims on the local Wi-Fi network to an attacker-controlled domain name service (DNS) server, and then onto malicious website.

A second flaw, CVE-2020-24587, takes advantage of the specification's failure to verify that each fragment of a packet is using the same encryption key. Using a specially constructed packet, an attacker can append code onto a legitimate fragment of the victim's original packet.

""While this actually seems secure, the problems begin when fragmentation is combined with session-key renewal,"" Vanhoef said. ""When the key is renewed, the packet numbers will be reset to 0. ... The problem is that the receiver will reassemble the packets even if the sender used different encryption keys.""

The final flaw, CVE-2020-24586, takes advantage of the lack of deletion of packet fragments from legitimate users on a Wi-Fi network. A malicious user can cache packets on the Wi-Fi network, which, under certain circumstances, will be inserted into other users' packets.

To allow vendors and researchers to verify the issues, Vanhoef published a testing tool to GitHub. The software requires the credentials of the Wi-Fi network, so it is not considered an attack tool.

Many device makers still do not handle vulnerability disclosure well. Vanhoef worked with the Wi-Fi Alliance to disclose the issues to vendors, and most issued patches. Vanhoef modified the test tool for specific vendors and continues to work with the group to support vendors.

""To my surprise, some companies were not happy, even if they managed to write patches for most devices,"" he said. ""I was actually happy that most devices got patches, because usually that is not the case for Wi-Fi.""

At the end of 2020, two new security measures became standard for WPA3 — operating channel validation and beacon protection — and while they make the fragmentation attacks harder, they are still possible.

New research suggests isolation among cloud customer accounts may not be a given -- and the researchers behind the findings issue a call to action for cloud security.

BLACK HAT USA 2021 - Las Vegas - A pair of researchers who have been rooting out security flaws and weaknesses in cloud services over the past year revealed here this week new issues that they say break the isolation among different customers' Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounts in the cloud.

Such cross-account cloud service vulnerabilities likely are more widespread than AWS, too, researchers Ami Luttwak and Shir Tamari of cloud security startup Wiz.io said of their findings.

The cross-account flaws suggest a chilling reality for cloud customers: that their cloud instances aren't necessarily isolated from those of the provider's other customers, according to the research. ""We showed that it's possible to manipulate services in AWS to access to other services,"" Tamari said in an interview. That could allow an attacker to read data in another cloud customer's S3 storage bucket, or send and store data from their cloud account to another customer's for nefarious purposes, the researchers demonstrated.

But the three security flaws the researchers found — vulnerabilities in AWS Config, CloudTrail, and AWS Serverless Config that AWS fixed earlier this year — merely reflect a bigger problem with securing cloud services. Luttwak and Tamari say their latest findings underscore the need for a CVE-type repository where cloud providers and researchers can share vulnerability information, and they plan to pursue an industry initiative that does just that.

""We think that cloud vulnerabilities are an industry problem. How do we make sure everybody knows about 'this' vuln? Every day, we're finding these [various] kinds of vulnerabilities"" in cloud services, Luttwak told attendees during the pair's presentation this week on the cross-account flaws they found in AWS late last year.

""It's about us as an industry and the need to share that"" information, said Luttwak, who has approached the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) with the proposed concept. The industry needs a database that lists cloud vulns, ""a 'CVE' system for the cloud,"" he explained.

That would provide a formal accounting of cloud vulns and include their severity ratings as well as the status of their fixes or patches. ""We need to be able to identify vulnerabilities and have good tracking numbers so customers and vendors can track those issues, and have a severity score for fixing those vulnerabilities,"" Tamari said in an interview.

Luttwak and Tamari's ""aha"" moment that led to their call to action for a centralized vulnerability tracking system for the cloud came when they found that five months after AWS had fixed the cross-account flaws they reported to the cloud services firm, some 90% of AWS Serverless Repository buckets were still improperly configured. So AWS customers apparently had not applied the new ""scoping condition"" setting in Serverless Repository, which AWS had alerted customers about via email and the AWS Personal Health Dashboard.

""Most are still using it configured [incorrectly] and with full access"" to their S3 storage buckets, Luttwak explained.

AWS sees the researchers' findings differently, however. An AWS spokesperson said that the issues reported by the researchers aren't vulnerabilities but instead configuration choices that some customers use and others prefer not to use.

More Vulns on the Horizon

Tamari noted that cloud security research is still a relatively new discipline, and there's plenty of unknown issues yet to be uncovered. ""There are so many new features [for cloud services], and it's very hard to track all the models and updates,"" he said, and cloud services can easily be misconfigured by an organization.

""The idea [is] that there are so many cloud services vulnerable to cross-connect vulns, we want the community to help search"" for them, he said. The hope is that sharing those findings among the security community could help raise awareness among organizations adopting and configuring cloud services.

Such HTTP/2 downgrades and protocol translations gives attackers a way to carry out Desync attacks, Kettle said.
For example, front-end servers speaking HTTP/2 follow a specific format for conveying message length to the back-end server.","HTTP/2 Implementation Errors Exposing Websites to Serious Risks

Organizations that don't implement end-to-end HTTP/2 are vulnerable to attacks that redirect users to malicious sites and other threats, security researcher reveals at Black Hat USA.

BLACK HAT USA 2021 - Implementation flaws and imperfections in the technical specifications around HTTP/2 are exposing websites using the network protocol to a brand-new set of risks, a security researcher warned in a presentation at Black Hat USA Thursday.

James Kettle -- director of research at PortSwigger who at Black Hat two years demonstrated so-called Desync attacks against websites using the HTTP protocol -- this week showed how similar attacks could be carried out with potentially severe consequences against websites using the HTTP/2 standard.

As proof-of-concept, Kettle described attacks he was able to execute using his techniques against websites belonging to organizations such as Netflix, those powered by Amazon's application load balancer, and websites using Imperva's cloud Web application firewall. In many instances he was able to redirect requests from Web-facing servers at these sites to his own server.

Nearly 50% of all websites currently use the HTTP/2 (H2) protocol, which was introduced in 2015 as a faster and simpler alternative to HTTP/1.1. As Google describes it, ""all the core concepts, such as HTTP methods, status codes, URIs, and header fields, remain in place,"" with the new protocol. ""Instead, HTTP/2 modifies how the data is formatted (framed) and transported between the client and server, both of which manage the entire process, and hides all the complexity from our applications within the new framing layer.""

According to Kettle, a whole slew of security issues can surface when organizations fail to use HTTP/2 in an end-to-end fashion. Instead, they have a front-end server that speaks HTTP/2 with clients and then rewrites requests from those clients back to HTTP/1.1 before forwarding them to a back-end server.

""A vast majority of the servers that speak HTTP/2 actually speak HTTP/1 to the back-end,"" he said during his Black Hat talk. They speak H2 to the client and H1 with the back-end, Kettle said.

""This set up is ridiculously common,"" he noted. Kettle pointed to Amazon's Application Load Balancer, for example, where this communication cannot be disabled. Such HTTP/2 downgrades and protocol translations gives attackers a way to carry out Desync attacks, Kettle said.

HTTP Desync attacks basically abuse weaknesses in how back-end servers interpret and respond to consecutive requests from a front-end server, load-balancer, or proxy server. For example, front-end servers speaking HTTP/2 follow a specific format for conveying message length to the back-end server. But a back-end server that only speaks HTTP/1.1 will not recognize the data because it derives information about the length of a request via other methods.

Attackers can take advantage of disagreements over message length between the front-end server and back-end server to essentially interfere with the way an application might handle requests.

High-Profile Targets

To show how such an attack would work, Kettle pointed to an exploit he executed against Netflix where front-end servers performed HTTP downgrading without verifying request lengths. The vulnerability allowed Kettle to develop an exploit that triggered Netflix's back-end to redirect requests from Netflix's front-end to his own server. That allowed Kettle to potentially execute malicious code to compromise Netflix accounts, steal user passwords, credit card information, and other data. Netflix patched the vulnerability and awarded Kettle its maximum bounty of $20,000 for reporting it to the company.

In another instance, Kettle discovered that Amazon's Application Load Balancer had failed to implement an HTTP/2 specification regarding certain message-header information that HTTP/1.1 uses to derive request lengths. With this vulnerability, Kettle was able to show how an attacker could exploit it to redirect requests from front-end servers to an attacker-controlled server. He found a vulnerable law-enforcement access portal while using the Amazon load balancer.

Almost every website using the Amazon load balancer was vulnerable to exploit, Kettle said. So, too, was a CMS powering multiple news sites such as Huffington Post - and every website using an Imperva WAF, he added.

During his presentation, Kettle highlighted several other exploits he had developed to take advantage of vulnerabilities that arise when organizations downgrade HTTP/2 to HTTP. He also released an updated version of HTTP Request Smuggler, a tool that organizations can use to detect HTTP/2 specific vulnerabilities on their network. Burp Suite vulnerability scanner has also been updated to detect these vulnerabilities, Kettle said.

""Please just avoid HTTP/2 downgrading,"" he advised. ""Just speak HTTP/2 end-to-end. If you do that, about 80% of the attacks from this presentation simply won't work.""

According to CISA, the JCDC will blend the various cyber capabilities of its members to better coordinate defense plans for federal, state, and local government agencies and the private sector and to run joint cyber defense exercises.","CISA Launches JCDC, the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative

""We can't do this alone,"" the new CISA director told attendees in a keynote at Black Hat USA today.

BLACK HAT USA 2021 – Las Vegas – Jen Easterly, the newly appointed director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), officially invited the security industry to team up with the federal government to proactively address and defend against the growing wave of cyberattacks on US organizations and government agencies that have intensified over the past year.

""Partner with us to raise the cybersecurity baseline of our data, of our networks, of our services, of our networks, and help us make the Internet a safer place,"" Easterly said in a prerecorded virtual keynote here today at Black Hat USA that was streamed on large video screens in the main ballroom of the Mandalay Bay Convention Center.

Just before Easterly's keynote, CISA officially announced the formation of the Joint Cyber Defense Collective (JCDC), a CISA initiative that will bring together government and private industry to work together on coordinated US cyber-defense operation plans for protecting and responding to cyberattacks and threats.

The aim of the JCDC is to establish a ""shared situational awareness of the threat environment"" for a jointly created national cyber-defense plan, Easterly said, and to map it to actual operation blueprints that can be employed to reduce cyber threats and risk to organizations in the US, ""so we develop real plans to defend the nation in cyber.""

Ransomware and cloud security are the JCDC's initial priorities, she said, specifically ""combating ransomware and planning a framework to respond to cyber incidents affecting cloud service providers.""

In addition to CISA, key federal government participants in the JCDC include the Defense Department, US Cyber Command, the National Security Agency, FBI, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Industry sector-specific agencies, such as the Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, Environmental Protection Agency, and the Food and Drug Administration, are expected to join the JCDC as it rolls out, Easterly said.

The first private-sector members are Amazon Web Services, AT&T, CrowdStrike, FireEye Mandiant, Google Cloud, Lumen, Microsoft, Palo Alto Networks, and Verizon.

""Microsoft has long maintained that security is a team sport, and with greater alignment and cooperation between government and industry, we can protect against emerging cyber threats,"" said Tom Burt, Microsoft's corporate vice president of customer security and trust, in a statement provided to Dark Reading. ""We applaud CISA's efforts to enhance collaboration for government and industry, and we look forward to participating in the Joint Cyber Defense Collaboration efforts to improve cyber defense.""

Cameron Camp, a security researcher at ESET, said the key is for federal agencies to be able to ""talk to each other"" to collaborate. Even with the group effort of government and industry, Camp believes combating ransomware attacks will be an ambitious goal. ""It's going to be really hard because you can't [just] stop ransomware quickly,"" he said.

According to CISA, the JCDC will blend the various cyber capabilities of its members to better coordinate defense plans for federal, state, and local government agencies and the private sector and to run joint cyber defense exercises.

Easterly ticked off three examples of recent collaborative efforts between CISA and private-sector security researchers. Victor Gevers, chairman of the Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure, provided details on the chain of vulnerabilities exploiting IT management software provider Kaseya earlier this year – information that CISA employed to help ""manage national response"" to the supply chain attack, she said.

Then there was Sean Metcalf of Trimarc, she said, who ""helped us understand the complications around identity management around the SolarWinds attack."" And Will Dormann, of Carnegie Mellon's CERT Coordination Center, provided analysis of the recently exploited PrintNightmare vulnerability to help tighten up the federal government's network security, she said.

In a lighter moment during her keynote, Easterly put up a slide depicting a logo that paid homage to the legendary rock band AC/DC with the lightning-bolt style logo JC/DC, along with a recorded electric guitar riff akin to the band's music.

The Three P's

Easterly's appeal to Black Hat attendees for forging a strong partnership between the public and private sector in cybersecurity is not the first time federal officials have solicited such a relationship. But this time, it's in the form of a collaborative venture emphasizing proactive planning and specific response plans for cyber threats to the US government and private-sector businesses.

""We can provide context to what you're seeing,"" she said.

The combination of insight and data from intel agencies and law enforcement, as well as anonymized intel gleaned from incident response cases that CISA has worked, can help warn other potential attack victims, said Easterly, whose career spans 20 years in the US Army, as well as high-level intelligence positions at the NSA and in the White House. She also helped design the US Cyber Command. Most recently, she served as the head of Firm Resilience and the Fusion Resilience Center at Morgan Stanley.

""With public-private partnership and information-sharing, my goal is to really breathe new life into these arguably hackneyed [terms],"" she said, with collaboration and timely, actionable information-sharing that helps organizations know how to better secure their networks.

""I fundamentally believe this approach will make us strong and help us secure the very complicated supply chain that underpins almost everything we do,"" Easterly said.

DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas in his locknote address at Black Hat USA today, which also was prerecorded and streamed, echoed Easterly's call for partnering with the DHS.

""I have said before that the DHS is fundamentally a department of partnerships,"" he said. The JCDC is ""one of many efforts underway to leverage our partners"" to keep the US safe, he said.

Mandiant experts discuss the novel techniques used to evade detection, automate data theft, and achieve persistent access.

BLACK HAT 2021 – Microsoft 365 is a hot target for cybercriminals, who constantly seek new ways to bypass its safeguards to access corporate data. And as defenders step up their game, attackers do the same.

""This past year has proved the point that nation-state-backed threat actors are increasingly investing time and money to develop novel ways to access data in Microsoft 365,"" said Josh Madeley, manager of professional services at Mandiant, in a briefing entitled ""Cloud with a Chance of APT: Novel Microsoft 365 Attacks in the Wild"" during this year's Black Hat USA.

These attackers are especially interested in Microsoft 365 because it's where more and more organizations store their data and collaborate, Madeley continued. Applications such as email, SharePoint, OneDrive, and Power BI can hold a wealth of information invaluable to attackers.

""If you're an espionage-motivated threat actor, Microsoft 365 is the holy grail,"" he said.

In the talk, Madeley and co-presenter Doug Bienstock, incident response manager at Mandiant, walked through lessons learned from large-scale espionage campaigns they've observed over the past year. Techniques they saw helped attackers disable security features like auditing and logging, automate data theft with old tactics, and abuse enterprise applications with new ones. They also maintained their access by abusing SAML and Active Directory Federation Services.

Madeley kicked off the talk with methods for evading detection. Attackers aren't interested in modifying data, he said. They want to steal the data, review it, and understand it. There are stealthy ways to do this, but attackers want to improve on their tactics and make it harder for defenders to catch them – ""especially if they want to perpetrate data theft over years,"" he said.

One way they do this is by disabling security features. All domain admins have access to the audit logs in Microsoft 365, though organizations that pay for an E5 subscription have access to advanced auditing. This comes with MailItemsAccessed, a feature that records any interactions with mail item objects within a 24-hour period, after which it's throttled.

It's a problematic feature for attackers looking to steal from corporate mailboxes, Madeley noted. They needed to find a way around it.

""Fortunately, Microsoft handed it to them in the Set-MailboxAuditBypassAssociation cmdlet,"" he continued. This prevents the logging of mailbox actions for specific users. When configured, any mailbox owner actions made by specified users who have the bypass configuration aren't going to be logged. Delegate actions performed by specified users on other target mailboxes are not logged, and certain admin actions are also not going to be logged, Madeley explained.

""You'd be well-served to monitor for the execution of this cmdlet in your tenant,"" he said of Set-MailboxAuditBypassAssociation. If an organization is monitoring for data theft, it may miss malicious activity if an attacker's target inbox isn't being logged.

A more efficient way to bypass logging is to downgrade critical users' licenses from E5 to E3, Madeley said. This disables MailItemsAccessed logging without affecting any of the features most people will use on a daily basis.

""These are really simple techniques, once you give admin access to a tenant, to make these changes to enable long term data theft,"" he added.

Mailbox Folder Permission Abuse

Another technique discussed was the abuse of mailbox folder permissions, which act as an alternative to mailbox delegations. Within a mailbox, an owner, admin, or account with full access permissions can grant permissions to other users that allow them to access specific folders within a mailbox. There are many legitimate use cases for this: sharing calendars, having team mailboxes, or allowing admin assistants to access particular folders.

""Just like administrators, attackers who have acquired sufficient permissions to a mailbox or a tenant can modify these permissions to allow them to access the folder contents,"" Madeley said. It's an older technique first documented by Black Hills Security in 2017 but is still effective.

The incident response team recently saw an APT actor lose access to multiple environments using a sophisticated means of targeting mailboxes, only to fall back on this method of abusing mailbox folder permissions.

""What was even more fascinating is, when they fell back on this method, there were no modifications made to the environment to enable it during the time of our investigation, which meant that those changes had been made a long time before,"" he noted.

Attackers will ultimately be after roles with ReadItems permissions, as this grants access to read mail items in a specific folder. There are several roles with this permission: Author, Editor, NonEditingAuthor, Owner, PublishingEditor, PublishingAuthor, and Reviewer. Madeley said that Reviewer, specifically, is the one his team has seen attackers use.

In addition to users within the tenant, there are two special users: an anonymous user, or any external unauthenticated user, and the default, or ""everyone"" user. The latter includes any internal and authenticated users. By default the access for both user types is set to None.

However, an attacker can take advantage. Madeley has seen attackers assign a default user to the Reviewer role, which would allow any authenticated user access to the mailbox folder. Permissions don't cascade down from ""child"" to ""parent"" for existing folders, but newly created folders will inherit the permission. This can be ""trivially done"" using the Set-MailboxFolderPermission cmdlet, he noted.

The attacker will still need to maintain some level of access through a valid account; however, with this modification, they don't need to maintain access to a specific account they want to target on a daily or weekly basis. Instead, they can use one compromised account to access 10 mailboxes with modified folder permissions.

Attacks require executing code on a system but foil Apple's approach to protecting private data and systems files.

BLACK HAT USA 2021 - Applications that are allowed to run on Apple's operating system, macOS, can exceed the permissions granted to them by the user and the operation system, allowing a variety of privacy attacks, such as grabbing address book information, taking screenshots, and gaining access to system files, two researchers stated at a Black Hat USA briefing on Aug. 4.

The researchers — Csaba Fitzl with Offensive Security and Wojciech Regula with SecuRing — found more than a score of vulnerabilities and insecure configurations that allowed the duo to bypass the core mechanism for protecting user privacy — Apple's Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC) privacy framework. The researchers used malicious plug-ins and process injection into third-party applications — among other approaches — to attack the TCC daemon and give their proof-of-concept attack full permissions on the system.

The two researchers reported the issues to Apple and many of them have been fixed. However, the security weaknesses are not just Apple's problem but also represent issues that third-party software makers need to fix, said Offensive Security's Fitzl during the presentation at Black Hat USA.

""There are too many Apple binaries with exceptions to access private data, which opens up the platform for abuses,"" he said. ""Many, many third-party applications are vulnerable to injection attacks, so if those applications have access to private resources, then those resources are vulnerable.""

While the vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely by themselves, similar issues have been used by attackers to bypass system protections on sensitive data. By convincing the user to run code on their system, the vulnerabilities can be exploited to bypass much of the data security built into Apple's macOS, iOS, and tvOS.

In May, Apple fixed issues in its macOS and tvOS that were exploited in the wild, allowing a malware program, known as XCSSET, to take screenshots and grab Safari browser cookies without requiring user permission. Bypassing privacy permissions on Apple's operation systems has become increasingly popular, as the typical permission request to the user through a dialog box will often tip them off to malware running on the system.

However, bypassing TCC is not a skeleton key to the system. Ransomware, for example, will not be able to encrypt system files following a TCC bypass — the attacker needs to do more, said SecuRing's Regula.

""Ransomware cannot encrypt privacy protected files because they are not only read protected, but write protected,"" he said.

Security for macOS is based on the System Integrity Protection (SIP) framework, which restricts access to many of the directories, even from a user with root privileges. TCC is based on SIP and provides the mechanism for protecting private data from access. Users interact with the TCC when they use privacy controls found in the Security & Privacy tab of the System Preferences control panel or when a permissions dialog box appears because an application wants to access private data or a private feature, such as the camera.

""TCC limits access to certain data, so that, for example, a malicious application cannot access your desktop or your address book,"" Regula said during the presentation.

The researchers discovered a variety of ways to gain access to applications or features that have the capability to make TCC changes, and through that method make their own malicious changes to permissions.

In one attack chain, the researchers used a malicious plug-in for the macOS Directory Utility, which keeps track of the user's home directory information, NFSHomeDirectory, to inject code into the process and update the TCC database with fake permissions. In another attack chain, the researchers found a variety of vulnerable system and third-party applications with permissions to change the TCC database and used process injection to change permissions and entitlements.

Researchers at Black Hat USA explain issues around defending ""Golden Secrets"" and present an approach to solving the problem.

BLACK HAT USA 2021 – Advanced persistent threat (APT) groups have long sought credentials to access, move laterally throughout, and persist in target networks. Defenders have attempted to mitigate the risk with multifactor authentication (MFA), which, while effective in most cases, can fall short of protecting the most lucrative data.

This was the crux of Black Hat USA briefing ""MFA-ing the Un-MFA-ble: Protecting Auth Systems' Core Secrets,"" presented today by ZenGo CTO Tal Be'ery and cryptography researcher Matan Hamilis, who demonstrated a new approach to protecting the ""golden secrets"" at the core of most modern authentication systems.

These secrets, such as KRBTGT for Kerberos or a private key for Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), are used to cryptographically secure the provision of access tokens and protect their integrity. This makes them a hot target for attackers: When one of these secrets is captured, it allows the holder to issue more golden access tokens offline to take over a system.

But what is SAML? Each modern corporate environment contains many different Web services served by many different vendors, explained Be'ery. Each service has its own form of authentication, which causes problems for defenders: There is no single sign-on, several passwords that employees may forget or reuse, and different forms of MFA for each tool.

With SAML, user management is shifted from the service provider (SP) to an identity provider (IdP), and authentication and directory are decoupled from the service. Instead of worrying about dozens of different apps and their authentication measures, admins configure the IdP to verify all employees' identities. The SP and IdP only communicate with each other with a key pair: The IdP signs with the private key, and the SP verifies with the public key.

A Golden SAML attack occurs when the attackers steal a private key from the identity provider and become a ""rogue IdP,"" Be'ery said. This allows them to generate arbitrary access SAML tokens offline, within the attackers' environment. Doing this would let attackers access a system as any user, in any role, while bypassing security policies and MFA. They could also slip past access monitoring, if access is only monitored by the identity provider, Be'ery said.

The security community saw this technique in the SolarWinds attack, which also marked the first publicly known use of Golden SAML in the wild, he noted. ""It seems like every year has its flagship breach; security incident, and this was Sunburst,"" said Be'ery.

SAML is a persistence technique, and ZenGo's team aimed to solve the problem of Golden SAML and the offline use of the IdP private key. Attackers have a time-limited access to IdP but get a long-term ""offline"" access to the target's assets.

As a solution reference, Be'ery pointed to MFA, which has largely solved the use of passwords as a persistence mechanism. He used four principles to outline why MFA is a good solution: The password is no longer a single point of failure, the extra factors are different (i.e., ""not two passwords""), more factors can be added if needed, and the added factor continues to rotate.

There are issues that prevent defenders from using MFA to protect golden secrets, said Be'ery, such as backward compatibility and lack of orthogonal additional factors. Attackers using Golden SAML can forge an identity with a stolen certificate, so they don't need to know someone's password or other authentication factors.

Could hardware security modules (HSMs) be used to address Golden SAML? In theory, HSMs can sign and prevent direct access to a private key; however, Be'ery then used the same standards he used to evaluate MFA. With HSMs, the private key is still a single point of failure, HSM systems must be continuously updated, and it doesn't scale. ""We had gone from software to hardware, but what's next … harder-ware?"" Be'ery quipped. Further, he added, HSMs are not short-lived.

Creating A Solution

Be'ery proposed a solution to solving the problem: ""What if we can have multiple signers?"" he said. In this solution, each token must be signed by multiple parties that are orthogonal; for example, a customer network and another third party. However, it requires changing the signers, which requires changing the standard and getting service providers on board, he noted.

The ZenGo approach involves the Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS), in which a private key is created in a distributed manner and signing is done in a distributed manner. The public key and signature verification remain the same; only the IdP as the signer needs to be updated.

Because the private key is distributed, it's no longer a single point of failure. With distributed protocols, back-and-forth messages are exchanged between parties. In key generation, each party creates a ""Share"" or their own secret, and using these Shares, parties sign together. The signature looks the same, and it's harder for attackers to steal because they would have to compromise both parties to do so.

""We're not creating the key in one single place and then splitting it and sending it to multiple parties. … This wouldn't help,"" Be'ery said.

Be'ery applied the same standards he used for MFA to the TSS approach: The private key is decentralized, each share resides in a different environment, and the number of parties is scalable. If two isn't enough, three can be used — or dozens more. Shares can also be rotated without changing the main secret.

Security leaders are challenged to fill application security and cloud computing jobs in particular, survey data shows.

BLACK HAT USA 2021 — Las Vegas — Is the cybersecurity skills shortage overstated? No, according to a recent survey of Information Systems Security Association (ISSA) members. The majority of respondents report the skills shortage is a significant problem that is hurting organizations.

ISSA, along with industry analyst firm Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG), surveyed 489 cybersecurity professionals and found 57% of organizations have been affected by the skills shortage. Most (95% of) respondents think the cybersecurity skills shortage and its associated effects have not improved over the past few years, and 44% say the problem has gotten worse. Only 5% say the shortage has improved.

""We are just not making progress,"" said ESG Analyst Jon Oltsik, who co-presented the data with Candy Alexander, Board President of ISSA International, in a session at this week's Black Hat conference titled ""The Life and Times of the Cybersecurity Professional"".

Security teams are feeling pinched because of the skills shortage, the top ramifications of which include an increasing workload for cybersecurity teams (62%), unfilled open job requisitions (38%), and high burnout among staff (38%).

Data shows the top 3 skills areas where a shortage is most acute are cloud computing security (39%), security analysis and investigations (30%), and application security (30%).

""Application security is an area that has been underinvested in for years,"" said Oltsik. ""But in an era of cloud native applications, development automation, of DevOps, it's become even more important.""

Alexander noted that the cultural tension between DevOps and security continues because of a lack of skilled help in application security.

""God bless the developers,"" she said. ""This has been a fight we've been trying to break through in the ISSA. We're really trying to have a common understanding and language of how can we partner to be better at developing secure applications.""

What actions can security leaders take to address the security skill shortage? Respondents were asked what they could do. Their top answers included increasing the commitment to cybersecurity training (39%), increasing compensation (37%), and providing incentives (35%).

To maintain and advance their skillsets, many security professionals need to participate in 40 hours of training each year. Nearly a quarter (21%) of those surveyed did not meet 40 hours of training per year. The main reason, as cited by 48% of respondents, is because their jobs do not pay for 40 hours of training per year and they can't afford it by themselves.

""Professionals are crying out for more training,"" said Oltsik. ""Training is beneficial. It will decrease risk at your organization, so this is really important.""

In his keynote address at Black Hat USA on Wednesday, Matt Tait, chief operating officer at Corellium, called for software platform vendors and security researchers to do their part to thwart the fallout of software supply chain compromises.

BLACK HAT USA 2021 - Las Vegas - The epic software supply chain attacks over the past year, including the high-profile breaches of SolarWinds, Microsoft Exchange Server, Kaseya, and Codecov, were only the beginning.

""Supply chain attacks are only just starting, and mostly with pretty small vendors that most people had not heard of beforehand,"" said Corellium COO Matt Tait, in a live conversation via video with Black Hat founder Jeff Moss. But what happens when these attacks get bigger and affect larger vendors and more of their customers?

Tait – who also delivered the prerecorded keynote, which was streamed on multiple large screens in a ballroom at the Mandalay Bay Conference Center in Las Vegas yesterday – said in the live portion of the event that the relative impact of these high-profile attacks could have been much worse given they were mostly targeted. He warned there will be more and they could well wreak more extensive and widespread damage to more organizations if the attackers hit larger targets with massive customer bases, such as the recent theft of source code from gaming giant EA Games.

""It's likely to start to escalate in the coming months and years,"" he said. ""And when something really big happens ... everything else will look like complete peanuts"" in comparison, he said. When a nation-state or cybercrime organization makes that leap and infiltrates more victims, it will no longer be a ""sustainable"" situation.

In his keynote, Tait, former information security specialist for the UK's GCHQ and more recently a member of Google's Project Zero team, outlined what he considers the three main factors that drove high-profile cyberattacks on Colonial Pipeline, Kaseya, Exchange Server, SolarWinds, and Codecov, as well as North Korea's targeting of security researchers and the NSO Pegasus Project iOS hacks.

While these attacks each were obviously different, they have a few common themes, he said. ""The intrusions caused really big physical, real-world challenges,"" such as the temporary interruption in gasoline distribution after Colonial Pipeline's ransomware attack. And many were driven by a supply chain compromise.

""Several were about stolen zero-days,"" as well, he said, pointing to the leaked Exchange flaw and North Korean nation-state hackers targeting security researchers to pilfer their findings. ""Some of these working exploits got into the hands of offensive hackers who used these in massive attacks.""

Another factor, he said: a major increase in the number of zero-day exploits over the past year or so, especially on mobile devices. ""The number of zero days being exploited in the wild is completely off the charts,"" Tait said.

But the good news for now is that widespread exploitation of those previously unknown vulnerabilities remains rare, he noted. Both nation-state cyberspies and ransomware gangs have become more aggressive, to the point that it's starting to overwhelm defenders. ""They want to do it in a way that's less costly"" to breach their targets, he said.

Security researchers are prime targets. ""If you're a security researcher and you're finding zero-days and they are high-impact, you are a target,"" Tait said. Attackers can more easily execute mass attacks if they can get hold of stolen or leaked exploits by researchers.

Katell Thielemann, vice president and analyst at Gartner, says supply chain breaches have indeed made hacking more cost-effective for attackers.

""The nature of supply chains is that they produce network effects with hard-to-predict second, third, and n-order effects,"" she says. ""They will increasingly be felt in the real world because now we are dealing with unsecure cyber-physical systems everywhere.""

Supply chain also encompasses firmware, hardware, and GPS systems, she says, so it's not just a software problem. ""The 'one-to-many' angle is out of the bag, but not just on the software front.""

The 'Fix'

Tait said the only way to minimize these supply chain attacks is for software platform vendors to ""fix the underlying technology."" International or national governments can't solve the issue, he said. ""Platform vendors have to step in.""

For Windows, that means tightening up user privileges into one that developers use so if an app gets compromised, malware's impact is reduced.

Take mobile devices, which have been targeted with zero-day flaws of late, especially iOS. Third-party, legal scanning of mobile apps at scale should be available, he said.

""We're only getting a tiny glimpse of what might be happening"" on mobile devices right now, he warned, calling for the ability to install ""security agents"" on mobile and perform forensics on the devices. That's a missing link for spotting exploits on the devices, he said.

It's up to platform vendors to make these changes, Tait added. ""Supply chains make massive exploitation by default and [make] ransomware mass destruction,"" he said.

At the inaugural Omdia Analyst Summit, experts discuss where the past year has created gaps in traditional security strategy and how organizations can fill them.

BLACK HAT USA 2021 – Many organizations have undergone sweeping technological and operational changes in the past 18 months, creating new conversations around how these new technologies and processes should be secured and who is tasked with protecting them.

This was the core of a keynote delivered by Maxine Holt, senior director of cybersecurity at Omdia, during the inaugural Omdia Analyst Summit at this year's Black Hat USA. Holt pointed to data from Omdia's latest ICT Enterprise Insights survey, which found 31.7% of organizations said cloud services adoption is ""significantly more important"" than it was before the pandemic.

""Whatever had to be done had to be done quickly,"" Holt said. Every company has had to evaluate data and business requirements as employees move off-premises into home offices. As they do, ""what we're finding now is the Band-Aid is being pulled back,"" she continued. Now, security teams are dealing with a ""mish-mash"" of security controls initially designed for offices.

""They're not fit for purpose in this 'reset normality' world, which means organizations are effectively failing in their security responsibilities,"" Holt added.

Customer experience is one example: Forty-two percent of Omdia respondents said customer experience is more important now than pre-pandemic, while 34% said it's significantly more important. One-quarter of respondents said creating a digital capability is significantly more important, while 45% said it's more important. Nearly 40% said managing security, identity, and privacy is more important now, while 33% said it's significantly more important – a stat Holt found encouraging.

""We can't have transformative work going on in an organization without consideration given to security and privacy,"" she said. With these priorities, the security team ""absolutely needs more investment"" as it moves from survival mode to helping the business thrive.

As remote and hybrid work become the new normal for many organizations, there is greater pressure on security teams to refine security controls using people, processes, and technology. More than one-fifth of businesses reported their security has kept up with the pace of change in 2020, said Holt, citing Dark Reading survey data. But for many, security has fallen behind.

""The inference from that is there are more gaps in the security posture of these organizations than there were in 2019,"" she noted. Omdia data shows 15% of businesses have a ""fully developed,"" proactive approach to security and digital risk, and 27% have a ""well-advanced"" approach. The remaining 58% have a ""substantially inadequate"" approach, said Holt.

Security teams struggle to keep up as they navigate the many obstacles standing in their way, Holt continued, listing the challenges of consistent vulnerability disclosure, compliance hurdles, the difficulty in hiring security practitioners, poor visibility into expanding cloud environments, a new generation of security operations center (SOC) capabilities, IT-driven attacks on critical infrastructure, and understanding and managing a broad community of users.

The complexity of cybersecurity demands a revised management structure, Holt said. She suggested assigning organizationwide responsibility for security with the role of a chief cybersecurity officer. Below this person are C-suite positions including a chief information security officer, chief information officer, chief risk officer, chief compliance officer, chief digital officer, and others.

""All have a dotted line to the chief cybersecurity officer,"" she added. ""Without someone to call the cybersecurity shots … it's so much more difficult to pull together all these necessary components to cybersecurity isn't haywire anymore.""

Having one person in charge can set the organization in the right direction.

""PwnedPiper"" flaws could allow attackers to disrupt delivery of lab samples or steal hospital employee credentials, new research shows.

Tucked behind the interior walls of thousands of hospitals in the US are little-known networks of air-pressurized tube systems that transport medications, bloodwork, and test samples among hospital departments, lab, and the operating room. One of the most popular of these so-called pneumatic tube system (PTS) stations recently was found to be harboring several vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit to wage disruptive attacks on this critical hospital delivery system or to steal or leak sensitive personal information on hospital employees.

Researchers at Armis discovered the flaws in the control panel of Swisslog Healthcare's TransLogic PTS system, a transport system used in more than 3,000 hospitals worldwide. An attacker could exploit the flaws in the TransLogic Nexus Control Panel, which runs the PTS stations, without authenticating to the network, according to Ben Seri, vice president of research at Armis, who along with researcher Barak Hadad will detail their findings this week at Black Hat USA in Las Vegas.

An older model of Swisslog's TransLogic PTS, its IQ station model that was sunsetted in 2017, also contains some of the flaws. That system is no longer supported by the vendor, so Swisslog customers should upgrade to the newer product, according to Armis.

The researchers have dubbed the flaws they found in Swisslog's Nexus Control Panel ""PwndPiper."" The vulnerabilities include two hard-coded passwords of user and root accounts that are accessible via default and fixed telnet access on the control panel (CVE-2021-37163) and four memory corruption flaws in the system's native TLP20 control protocol implementation that could be used for remote code execution and denial-of-service attacks. These are buffer- and stack overflow-type flaws and have been reported as CVE-2021-37161, CVE-2021-37162, CVE-2021-37165, and CVE-2021-37164.

Nexus Control Panel also contains a privilege escalation flaw that could allow root access via telnet and hard-coded credentials to gain root access (CVE-2021-37167), and a denial-of-service (DoS) flaw (CVE-2021-37166) in the graphical user interface on the control panel that could allow an attacker to wage a DoS by impersonating GUI commands. The Nexus Control Panel also contains a design flaw that allows unsigned, as well as unauthenticated and unencrypted, firmware updates (CVE-2021-37160) to the system, the researchers found.

Seri says if an attacker hacks a Nexus station via any of these flaws, they could wrest control of all Nexus stations on the PTS network and wage a ransomware attack, for instance, or steal data from the stations, including employee RFID credentials as well as other intelligence about the PTS's physical configuration.

""The Nexus Control Panel powers the stations on-premises. Once you compromise a station, without [needing] credentials, you can harvest any employee credentials to access these systems,"" including their RFID cards that open doors at the hospital building, he says.

Meanwhile, Swisslog today issued a software update for the firmware, v7.2.5.7, which patches all but one of the vulnerabilities, CVE-2021-37160, the unsigned firmware issue. The vendor for now is providing mitigation steps for that vuln.

""In May, cyber security platform provider Armis approached us to share that it found some potential vulnerabilities to our TransLogic firmware that drives a specific panel in some pneumatic tube systems if a bad actor was first able to successfully gain access to a hospital's secure network, know and understand the pathway from there to the panel, and then leverage the vulnerabilities,"" a Swisslog spokesperson said in a statement provided to Dark Reading. ""We immediately started collaborating on both short-term mitigation and long-term fixes.""

Swisslog said in its advisory issued today that the firmware flaws affect the HMI-3 circuit board in the Nexus Panels when the systems are Ethernet-connected, and the affected systems are mostly used in hospitals in North America. An attacker would need access to the victim's IT network to exploit the vulnerabilities, according to Swisslog.

While Armis and Swisslog say they worked closely on the remediation and disclosure of the vulnerabilities, they still disagree on the total number of flaws. Armis says the eight CVEs account for nine flaws it discovered (it points to the two hard-coded passwords in CVE-2021-37163), but Swisslog says Armis counted nine after considering ""one vulnerability could have more than one impact and is claiming it as two vulnerabilities,"" according to a Swisslog spokesperson.

Armis' Seri describes it this way: ""So these two accounts that have hard-coded passwords were assigned a single CVE. Swisslog removed one of these accounts — the user — but the root account still remained in the firmware after the patch. For that reason, it is clear these are separate vulnerabilities since they will have two separate solutions.""

Yet Another IoT/OT Security Risk

Swisslog's Nexus Station devices are based on an older version of the Linux kernel, v2.6, and managed by a Windows-based central server that sits atop the entire PTS network. Among the features of the network are secure transfers of delivery, using the employee's RFID and password, and email and SMS alerts upon delivery of a container.

""Ten years ago, these systems were mainly used for testing,"" Seri says. ""But now they are more integrated with the hospital and relying more on them for medicine and blood units,"" so disruption of them would be serious.

The Swisslog system had in its production version a hard-coded password ""left inadvertently"" from a developer of the system, notes Seri, and it could be used via telnet to run code remotely on the system.

PTS systems are yet another once-isolated physical system ultimately found to be prone to cyberattacks after joining the IP-based network infrastructure. They've traditionally been ""secure"" because of their obscurity, he notes.

""I do think this should be a wakeup call for a hospital to go ahead and finish up the segmentation"" on it network, Seri says. ""Most have segmented it for their medical devices, but other systems that are not as directly connected to patients"" still affect patient care and need to be segmented and secured, he says.

""The central server and all stations can talk to [those] devices and should not talk to any other device on the network,"" for instance, he says.

Armis today published the technical details of its findings.

In response to growing concerns regarding the recent uptick in large-scale, nation-state-backed ransomware attacks on critical infrastructure, the Biden administration is taking new action to tackle the evolving challenges posed by ransomware attacks.

When considering the cybersecurity CIA triad of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, each component is essential to the secure operation of every organization.

However, when the consistent and reliable availability of necessary data is lost as a result of a ransomware incident, it is perhaps the most crippling of the three. Denial of access to data can cripple operations and bring everything to a grinding halt. To add insult to injury, the absolute urgency and panic that system denial creates in victims only exacerbates the challenge of responding to a ransomware attack.

Adversaries now commonly use ransomware to quickly and efficiently steal victims' access to valuable data. The ransomware ""industry"" has matured in several ways: through the anonymity provided via the anonymity granted through the Internet and digital currency, combined with the low-risk/high-reward mechanics involved with ransoming a victim’s files, plus the evolution and increasing monetization of ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS). All ""flavors"" of customizable ransomware toolkits can be found for sale on the Dark Web. While already a troubling concept to consider, such offerings have facilitated the fast and massive global proliferation of ransomware toolkits.

Task Force Takes All-Hands-on-Deck Approach

As a result of the growth and development of sophisticated, technically knowledgeable, well-funded, and often nation-state-backed ransomware gangs, developing and deploying any lasting and comprehensive countermeasures will require a herculean effort.

Given the increased frequency of the attacks, combined with the severity of consequences that stem from a successful strike, no single entity can possibly hope to coordinate such a large-scale disruption of these ransomware campaigns alone. A truly extensive response requirement will demand international cooperation from government organizations, private entities, and defense agencies worldwide.

In light of the significant national security implications surrounding repeated ransomware strikes against critical infrastructure, the Biden administration recently announced plans for the deployment of a cross-government ransomware task force. This task force, composed of an interagency group of senior security officials, will help to further facilitate defensive capabilities to protect against attacks by promoting data security resilience among critical infrastructure entities.

The task force will seek to coordinate with US allies to direct any offensive responses against evolving attack campaigns, while simultaneously working to disrupt ransom payments proffered on various cryptocurrency platforms.

Additionally, the US Department of Justice announced plans to elevate ransomware investigations to the same level of priority as terrorist attacks, granting greater access to government resources to assist in mitigation efforts.

Administration officials are increasingly concerned now that ransomware attacks frequently exploit various supply chain vulnerabilities as a preferred method of compromise. Attacks such as these target popular software solutions to reach a larger pool of potential victims. Challenges surrounding these supply chain attacks plague government agencies and private sector companies alike. While many organizations are still recovering from the SolarWinds breach that occurred at the end of 2020, the recent ransomware strike against popular vendor Kaseya shows that such threats are likely to continue in the absence of a coordinated response.

Security Concerns Spark Geopolitical Tensions

Many recent ransomware attacks are believed to have originated in countries that are adversarial to the US. This poses additional challenges. The very clandestine nature of the attacks, in addition to the anonymity surrounding payment, make any kind of accountability difficult to impose. For example, the FBI claimed that the culprits of the Colonial Pipeline attack, a ransomware network known as DarkSide, are based in Russia and are operating with Russian President Vladimir Putin's full knowledge. As expected, Putin has dismissed accusations against Moscow as unfounded. However, several US government officials have commented that even as Putin is more than likely completely aware of the criminal activity stemming from within his country’s borders, these gangs are so autonomous that Putin himself may be powerless to truly disrupt them.

Furthermore, the Biden administration has also accused the Chinese government of helping to facilitate various cyberattacks including ransomware, extortion, theft, and even crypto-jacking. The administration alleges that China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) was also responsible for an attack on Microsoft's Exchange email server earlier this year that compromised more than 30,000 organizations that rely on this service to facilitate daily operations. The Department of Justice has gone one step further with China, and has officially charged four Chinese nationals with illicit computer network exploitation activities, as part of a Chinese advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as APT40.

However, there are growing concerns regarding any kind of official US retaliation against either Russia or China. Officials have expressed considerable concern regarding any form of cyber standoff that may manifest between the US and an adversarial leader or nation. There are considerable fears that any kind of retaliatory action from the US could further escalate into even more orchestrated attacks against the US, its interests, and its allies.

Only time will tell if the geopolitical posturing between these superpowers will result in a digital détente.

DOJ indicts four Chinese individuals for alleged role in attacks targeting intellectual property, trade secrets belonging to defense contractors, maritime companies, aircraft service firms, and others.

The Biden Administration along with members of the European Union, U.K., and NATO Monday accused China of using cybercriminals to conduct worldwide cyber espionage operations to obtain unfair competitive advantage for its companies and commercial sectors.

The hackers, affiliated with China's Ministry of State Security (MSS), have conducted the malicious operations both for the government and for their own personal gain, a White House statement noted. The statement publicly attributed these actors for numerous attacks earlier this year against four zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Server that caused widespread concern.

""The [People's Republic of China's] pattern of irresponsible behavior in cyberspace is inconsistent with its stated objective of being seen as a responsible leader in the world,"" the White House statement said. Criminal hackers associated with the MSS have engaged in ransomware attacks, crypto-jacking and ""rank-theft"" from organizations around the world for the past several years, it noted.

Simultaneously, the US Department of Justice unsealed indictments against four individuals for allegedly working for MSS in a multi-year campaign to steal intellectual property, trade secrets, and other sensitive data from organizations in the maritime, aviation, defense, and multiple other sectors. The attackers in various campaigns between 2011 and 2018 helped steal technologies related to submersibles, autonomous vehicles, high-speed railways, and aircraft, the DOJ said. Also targeted was data from genetic sequencing projects and research around diseases such as Ebola, MERS, and HIV/AIDS. The hacking campaign in which the four indicted individuals allegedly operated had targeted organizations in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, Norway, and Saudi Arabia.

This is the second time in three months that the Biden Administration has publicly named and shamed a foreign government for alleged hacking activity against US and allied government interests. In May, the government blamed Russia's foreign intelligence service (SVR) for the supply chain attack on SolarWinds that impacted thousands of organizations worldwide. At the time, the US Treasury Department slapped sanctions against a handful of Russian technology firms for their alleged role in the campaign.

Security experts then and now viewed the action as important in terms of holding foreign actors accountable for malicious cyber activity against the US. However, whether sanctions and indictments will deter such behavior remains an open question. Lisa Plaggemier, interim executive director at the National Cyber Security Alliance, says the government actions reflect the heightening tensions among major nations around cybersecurity. ""The unsealed indictments against Chinese residents accused of hacking US entities from 2011 to 2018 further underscores just how warm the new 'cyber 'Cold War' has become for many of the global superpowers today,"" she says.

But given the constantly escalating nature of cyberattacks and the fact that the threat actors in this case are criminal hackers, the public attribution is unlikely to stop their attacks. ""It is highly likely that we have not seen the last of attacks such as these, especially as ransomware attacks ramp-up as bad actors look to monetize their nefarious actions,"" Plaggemier says.

Source: DoJ

Significantly, much of the activity that the indicted individuals are alleged to have engaged in on behalf of the MSS occurred after a 2015 accord between then-US President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping of China that expressly forbade cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property and trade secrets.

The Obama administration made history in May of 2014 with the country's first-ever criminal charges filed for cyber espionage, when the US Department of Justice indicted five members of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) with hacking into US businesses to steal trade secrets.

Elaborate Conspiracy

The DOJ indictment unsealed in a federal court in California describes in detail the allegedly elaborate lengths the Chinese government went to obfuscate the malicious activity. In 2011, the four indicted individuals - working with a provincial arm of the MSS called the Hainan State Security Department (HSSD) - allegedly established an information security company called the Hainan Xiandun Technology Development Company to serve as a front for the malicious activity.

Ding Xiaoyang, Cheng Qingmin, and Zhu Yunmin, three HSSD officers named in the indictment, allegedly were responsible for finding, hiring, and managing hackers and linguists at Hainan Xiandun as well as several other entities that were similarly engaged in organized cyber-spying for China. Staff and professors at a Hainan-based university allegedly helped manage the now defunct-Hainan Xiandu's payroll and employee benefits for the HSSD. The Hainan-based university was one of several in the region and around the country that assisted MSS in identifying and recruiting hackers to support the country's strategic objectives through cyber-spying.

The fourth individual named in the indictment is Wu Shurong, an alleged malware author and hacker who supervised other hackers at Hainan Xiandun in their efforts to break into networks belonging to foreign companies, governments, and universities.

The charging documents list intrusions at more than 20 unnamed organizations—including seven US universities, a US defense contractor, and Swiss chemical company—in which the four indicted individuals allegedly played a role. In these attacks, the individuals and their accomplices used spearphishing emails, fictitious online profiles, spoofed domains, and stolen credentials to gain initial access to targeted networks and to distribute malware on them for lateral movement, spying, and data theft.

A First

Monday's White House announcement and the indictments are noteworthy because this is the first time that the US has publicly accused the Chinese government of using contract hackers to do its spying work in return for turning a blind eye to their criminal activities.

The US allegations bear out what security vendors have long described as a strong nexus between the Chinese government, academic institutions, and criminal hacker groups around cyberespionage activity.

Over the years, multiple security vendors have tracked the malicious activity under various names including APT40, Bronze Mohawk, GreenCrash, Kryptonite Panda, Periscope, and Mudcarp. In March 2019, for instance, FireEye identified APT40 as a threat group conducting cyberespionage against organizations in the engineering, transportation, and the defense sectors, on behalf of the Chinese government. The security vendor assessed the group's mission was to support an ambitious China naval modernization effort. In March 2020, Microsoft, which has been tracking the activity by the name Gadolinium. described the threat actor as conducting a decade long worldwide cyber espionage on maritime and healthcare industries in support of a nation-state actor's strategic national goals.

The US Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Agency (CISA) Monday released an alert with details on APT40's attack tactics, techniques, and procedures and advice on how to spot and mitigate them.

""The links between APT40 to China's Ministry of State Security operating out of Hainan Island is consistent with technical evidence that Mandiant has previously identified showing that operators were likely located there,"" said Ben Read, director of analysts at FireEye's Mandiant Threat Intelligence group. ""The indictment highlights the significant threat to multiple businesses from Chinese espionage,"" Read said in an emailed statement.

The CD Projekt Group has had a bad six months.

In December, the video game company launched its much-anticipated Cyberpunk 2077 with significant bugs, especially on non-PC systems, leading to viral memes and some scathing reviews. In February, as it struggled to fix extensive flaws in the game, hackers stole source code and encrypted data, demanding that the company ""come to an agreement."" And last month, CD Projekt revealed its internal data — including details on current and former employees and contractors — is now circulating on the Internet.

The company is working with European and international police, as well as investigators in its home country of Poland, it said in a statement posted to Twitter.

""We would also like to state that — regardless of the authenticity of the data being circulated — we will do everything in our power to protect the privacy of our employees, as well as all other involved parties,"" the company said. ""We are committed and prepared to take action against parties sharing the stolen data.""

Such incidents are not isolated. In June, Electronic Arts revealed it was investigating claims that its software and data were being sold on underground forums. Overall, application and Web attacks on gaming companies have risen 340% in 2020 compared to the previous year, according to a report released last week by network services and security firm Akamai. While gaming companies may have additional drama from a dedicated fanbase that also includes hackers, the attacks are, in most ways, no different than what other industries experience daily.

There are lessons to be learned from criminals' efforts against the gaming industry, especially as more companies move to the cloud and enterprise infrastructure increasingly resembles gaming infrastructure, says Steve Ragan, security researcher at Akamai.

""Everyone is trying to get more into the cloud, and it's not just gaming companies,"" he says. ""Almost every company is doing more hosted access to the end user.""

As cloud infrastructure, greater mobile access, and zero-trust frameworks become prevalent across organizations, the gaming industry has some lessons to share.

Shift to Mobile Shifts Security Risk

Mobile has become the dominant platform in gaming, accounting for 35% of the $151 billion in annual gaming revenue in the United States and more globally. ""Young people who do not have access to a console or PC are playing competitively on mobile devices,"" says Ryan Lloyd, chief product officer at mobile application security firm GuardSquare. ""In the rest of the world, mobile devices are the platform of choice.""

Companies outside the gaming industry should take note, because the applications that businesses rely on look increasingly like gaming infrastructure. The cloud-native approach to mobile applications is growing common for consumer and business applications as well.

This makes the applications and backend cloud infrastructure targets, says Lloyd.

""The device is less a target of attack, because attackers are more focused on the app,"" he says. ""Because it [is] an issue of scale — if you compromise the app, you can affect a lot more devices.""

Know Your Customer

There is a love-hate relationship between many gamers and companies that make the worlds in which they play. And these emotions often drive attacks.

The gaming industry, for example, is the most common target of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. While such attacks dropped by 20% in 2020, the gaming industry bore the brunt of them, as they typically do every year. Driven by gamers trying to gain advantage over other players, or to punish the gaming company, DDoS attacks against gaming infrastructure accounted for 46% of all distributed denial-of-service attacks, according to Akamai's Gaming in a Pandemic report.

""Gamers do have a love-hate relationship with the companies,"" Akamai's Ragan says. ""They will get excited about the games, and then they will turn right around and complain about everything ... many turn to attacks.""

Companies need to know their customers because attackers have done their research. Cybercriminals consistently target gaming accounts of the most popular games, keeping track of when specific events occur to exploit potentially chaotic transitions, he says.

""Criminals know what games are hot — they pay attention to the lifecycles in the gaming industry,"" Ragan says. ""If you look at the peaks, they correspond to patch-release days, updates to various games, and new game drops.""

The technique is common, and companies need to be wary that maintenance times are popular times to attack as well.

Poor Security Decisions Put Companies at Risk

Gaming companies must give players as many protections as possible because in many cases, users — whether consumers or employees — make potentially dangerous decisions without considering security. Users regularly download free clones of games or applications to cheat at their favorite games, and these often come with unwanted features or security exploits.

Twelve of the top 25 paid iOS games have free-to-play hacks and 10 of the top 25 games had cheats available, according to Guardsquare.

Employees are consumers too. The increase of people working from home likely means more are installing questionable software, Lloyd says.

""Bring-your-own-device policy enables people to install whatever on their mobile devices — that's even true of laptops,"" he says. ""It's like the iceberg — whatever you are seeing, there is a lot more going beneath the surface.""

Don't Just Authenticate, Educate

In a previous report released in September 2020, Akamai surveyed gamers and found more than half (55%) had an account stolen. Little wonder then, that nearly all (89%) used some form of multi-factor authentication and 30% used a password manager.

Multi-factor authentication works, Ragan says, but customers and employees need to be educated on why it's necessary. Gaming companies effectively put the tradeoff in terms users understand, and gamers have heard enough stories of stolen accounts to take the threat seriously, he adds.

""Criminals get really frustrated when they can't use a basic username and password to get into an account, and they move on,"" he says. ""It works, but you have to enforce it and educate your users, tell them why it is there.""

In the end, companies need to treat their employees and customers like game makers treat gamers: they are valuable, a source of vulnerability, and committed enough to go rogue if they are unhappy with the business. Educating workers and reaching out to customers can lead to a more secure outcome.

""There is a lot of front-end education toward the players, teach them the value of multi-factor authentication, why not to reuse passwords, and how to spot phishing attacks,"" Ragan says. ""If you do it right, criminals will have to move on.""

In the spring of 2018, the city of Atlanta's computers began seizing up.

It wasn't due to user error or outdated platforms: The city's data was being systematically attacked and encrypted by ransomware — an insidious form of malware that encrypts files on a victim's network and demands a ransom, paid out in cryptocurrency, for the decryption key.



Atlanta didn't pay the $50,000 worth of bitcoin the hackers were demanding — nor did they have the chance to do so. The payment portal was taken offline, the city was left with a hobbled network, and IT professionals scrambled to bring the city's systems back online. At the end of the day, the total cost to the city was north of $2.7 million.

Atlanta's experience, of course, is far from unique. Ransomware is a growing problem — what some experts are calling an epidemic — and it's one that state, county, and local governments are woefully ill-prepared to deal with.

In 2020 alone, at least 2,400 public entities were hit by ransomware attacks, says Michael Garcia, senior policy adviser at Third Way's National Security Program and member of the Institute for Security and Technology's Ransomware Task Force. And according to research conducted by Comparitech, over the past three years ransomware has affected an estimated 173 million people and may have cost up to $52.88 billion.

""We never want to be alarmists, but I think now we have cause to be alarmed,"" Garcia says. ""Governments control the water we drink, the traffic lights that guide traffic, as well as airports and schools, for instance, and our day-to-day lives rely on a functioning public sector. Now most every aspect of the public sector is at risk of these disruptive attacks.""

In the early days of ransomware attacks, the common wisdom was to simply pay the ransom and sweep the attack under the rug. Michael Makstman, chief information security officer for the City and County of San Francisco, says that approach has led to larger problems today.

""I think paying ransom in the last few years fueled the ransomware industry,"" Makstman says. ""It's left us all in a worse place.""

Indeed, ransomware attacks are now more sophisticated, the payments demanded are much higher, and cybercriminals mostly operate with impunity. And many local jurisdictions just don't have the resources and expertise to fight them.

How Local Governments Can Prepare

Obviously, steps for defending against a ransomware attack vary based on the size of the government entity and the resources available to each one. Huge metros will take different approaches than small townships that lack dedicated IT security staff.

However, some universal best practices include hardening systems, making sure software is up-to-date, utilizing two-factor authentication, and training employees on best security practices. But for local governments, rooting out ransomware ultimately will come down to two things: system architecture and partnerships.

Makstman compares the former to a city's zoning codes and fire departments.

""For example, just as the fire department ensures that a fire in any one place does not burn down the whole city, we have to architect our environments, our technology, in such a way to reduce impact and spread of the event and ask the question where [do] we have those firewalls in place? Where [do] we have a separation [between systems]?"" he says.



This involves taking into account the fact that people will make mistakes, intruders will get in, and damage will occur, Makstman adds. The key, he says, is building systems in such a way that one user error or one piece of malicious code won't take the whole network down.

This is an exceedingly daunting task for most governments, he concedes, but it's one that must be undertaken to mitigate the threat of ransomware.

""We have to be smart in our design,"" Makstman says.

One useful resource is the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and Multi-State Information Sharing & Analysis Center (MS-ISAC)'s ""Ransomware Guide,"" which provides best practices and guidance on how to evaluate your threat level for a ransomware attack and how to mitigate the risk of becoming a victim. Keeping updated, offline backups and segmenting your network are key best security practices. They also are major factors in preventing an attack and minimizing damage if one occurs.

MS-ISAC itself offers training, webinars, and free security tools. Its mission is to improve the overall cybersecurity posture of state and local governments across the country by focusing on threat prevention, protection, response, and recovery.

""At this point, the MS-ISAC has over 11,000 SLTT [state, local, tribal, and territorial government] members,"" says Josh Moulin, MS-ISAC's senior vice president and deputy of operations and security services. ""We provide them with a number of different things that they can take advantage of to help them mature their cybersecurity posture.""

But oftentimes governments exist in silos, which thwart their ability to team up to protect themselves from ransomware attacks.

""One of the things that I think is key is partnerships and working with other organizations and groups,"" says Daniel Clark Lee, the City of Los Angeles' integrated security operations center manager.

Governments need to understand the importance of partnering, he adds, because ransomware isn't an issue that affects one entity — it affects all members of an ecosystem.

Los Angeles’ Cyber Lab is a public-private partnership that aims to leverage knowledge and experience across both sectors to better prepare the community as a whole to deal with cyberthreats. Christopher Covino, policy director for cybersecurity in the office of Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, says this mindset has led to a posture of collective defense, where information and resources are shared to help protect everyone.

There are more than 80 cities and special districts in the L.A. region, an area that includes LA Metro transit authority and the Los Angeles Unified School District. ""If any of these organizations went down because of a ransomware attack, it's going to have a significant impact on the whole region,"" he says.

The Mayor's Office leads a regional Cyber Collective Defense initiative focused on sharing information on potential cyberthreats. ""For example, we provide machine-to-machine indicator-of-compromise sharing via LA Cyber Labs Threat Intelligence Sharing Platform. We coordinate joint threat briefs with local, state, and federal partners and produce and disseminate joint city/Cyber Lab Fusion center cyber advisories,"" he explains.

Ransomware Task Force

The Institute for Security and Technology’s Ransomware Task Force recently released a report that provides recommendations for a comprehensive framework to tackle the ransomware problem on a global basis.

Among the task force's recommendations: a coordinated effort by international diplomatic and law enforcement agencies to prioritize ransomware through a well-resourced strategy to direct nation-states away from offering safe haven to cybercriminals; government recovery funds for ransomware attack response and mandated alternatives to ransom payment; and a White House-led anti-ransomware campaign.

""Tackling ransomware will not be easy; there is no silver bullet for solving this challenge,"" the report states. ""Most ransomware criminals are based in nation-states that are unwilling or unable to prosecute this cybercrime, and because ransoms are paid through cryptocurrency, they are difficult to trace. This global challenge demands an “all hands on deck” approach, with support from the highest levels of government.""

In the right hands, artificial intelligence and machine learning can enrich our cyber defenses. In the wrong hands, they can create significant harm.

Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are now part of our everyday lives, and this includes cybersecurity. In the right hands, AI/ML can identify vulnerabilities and reduce incident response time. But in cybercriminals' hands, they can create significant harm.

Here are seven positive and seven negative ways AI/ML is impacting cybersecurity.

7 Positive Impacts of AI/ML in Cybersecurity

Fraud and Anomaly Detection: This is the most common way AI tools are coming to the rescue in cybersecurity. Composite AI fraud-detection engines are showing outstanding results in recognizing complicated scam patterns. Fraud detection systems' advanced analytics dashboards provide comprehensive details about incidents. This is an extremely important area within the general field of anomaly detection.

Vulnerability Management: It can be difficult to manage vulnerabilities (manually or with technology tools), but AI systems make it easier. AI tools look for potential vulnerabilities by analyzing baseline user behavior, endpoints, servers, and even discussions on the Dark Web to identify code vulnerabilities and predict attacks.

It can be difficult to manage vulnerabilities (manually or with technology tools), but AI systems make it easier. AI tools look for potential vulnerabilities by analyzing baseline user behavior, endpoints, servers, and even discussions on the Dark Web to identify code vulnerabilities and predict attacks. Anti-malware: AI helps antivirus software detect good and bad files, making it possible to identify new forms of malware even if it's never been seen before. Although complete replacement of traditional techniques with AI-based ones can speed detection, it also increases false positives. Combining traditional methods and AI can detect 100% of malware.

Data-Leak Prevention: AI helps identify specific data types in text and non-text documents. Trainable classifiers can be taught to detect different sensitive information types. These AI approaches can search data in images, voice records, or video using appropriate recognition algorithms.

AI helps identify specific data types in text and non-text documents. Trainable classifiers can be taught to detect different sensitive information types. These AI approaches can search data in images, voice records, or video using appropriate recognition algorithms. SIEM and SOAR: ML can use security information and event management (SIEM) and security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) tools to improve data automation and intelligence gathering, detecting suspicious behavior patterns, and automating the response depending on the input.

AI/MI is used in network traffic analysis, intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, secure access service edge, user and entity behavior analytics, and most technology domains described in Gartner's Impact Radar for Security. In fact, it's hard to imagine a modern security tool without some kind of AI/ML magic in it.

7 Negative Impacts of AI/ML in Cybersecurity

Data Gathering: Through social engineering and other techniques, ML is used for better victim profiling, and cybercriminals leverage this information to accelerate attacks. For example, in 2018, WordPress websites experienced massive ML-based botnet infections that granted hackers access to users' personal information.

Ransomware: Ransomware is experiencing an unfortunate renaissance. Examples of criminal success stories are numerous; one of the nastiest incidents led to Colonial Pipeline's six-day shutdown and $4.4 million ransom payment.

Spam, Phishing, and Spear-Phishing: ML algorithms can create fake messages that look like real ones and aim to steal user credentials. In a Black Hat presentation, John Seymour and Philip Tully detailed how an ML algorithm produced viral tweets with fake phishing links that were four times more effective than a human-created phishing message.

Deepfakes: In voice phishing, scammers use ML-generated deepfake audio technology to create more successful attacks. Modern algorithms such as Baidu's ""Deep Voice"" require only a few seconds of someone's voice to reproduce their speech, accents, and tones.

Modern algorithms such as Baidu's ""Deep Voice"" require only a few seconds of someone's voice to reproduce their speech, accents, and tones. Malware: ML can hide malware that keeps track of node and endpoint behavior and builds patterns mimicking legitimate network traffic on a victim's network. It can also incorporate a self-destructive mechanism in malware that amplifies the speed of an attack. Algorithms are trained to extract data faster than a human could, making it much harder to prevent.

Algorithms are trained to extract data faster than a human could, making it much harder to prevent. Passwords and CAPTCHAs: Neural network-powered software claims to easily break human-recognition systems. ML enables cybercriminals to analyze vast password data sets to target password guesses better. For example, PassGAN uses an ML algorithm to guess passwords more accurately than popular password-cracking tools using traditional techniques.

For example, PassGAN uses an ML algorithm to guess passwords more accurately than popular password-cracking tools using traditional techniques. Attacking AI/ML Itself: Abusing algorithms that work at the core of healthcare, military, and other high-value sectors could lead to disaster. Berryville Institute of Machine Learning's Architectural Risk Analysis of Machine Learning Systems helps analyze taxonomies of known attacks on ML and performs an architectural risk analysis of ML algorithms. Security engineers must learn how to secure ML algorithms at every stage of their life cycle.

It is easy to understand why AI/ML is gaining so much attention. The only way to battle devious cyberattacks is to use AI's potential for defense. The corporate world must notice how powerful ML can be when it comes to detecting anomalies (for example, in traffic patterns or human errors). With proper countermeasures, possible damage can be prevented or drastically reduced.

Overall, AI/ML has huge value for protecting against cyber threats. Some governments and companies are using or discussing using AI/ML to fight cybercriminals. While the privacy and ethical concerns around AI/ML are legitimate, governments must ensure that AI/ML regulations won't prevent businesses from using AI/ML for protection. Because, as we all know, cybercriminals do not follow regulations.

The implications make for perhaps the most interesting plot twist in the story of CSAM Detection.","In early August 2021, Apple unveiled its new system for identifying photos containing images of child abuse. Although Apple’s motives — combating the dissemination of child pornography — seem indisputably well-intentioned, the announcement immediately came under fire.

Apple has long cultivated an image of itself as a device maker that cares about user privacy. New features anticipated for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 have already dealt a serious blow to that reputation, but the company is not backing down. Here’s what happened and how it will affect average users of iPhones and iPads.

What is CSAM Detection?

Apple’s plans are outlined on the company’s website. The company developed a system called CSAM Detection, which searches users’ devices for “child sexual abuse material,” also known as CSAM.

Although “child pornography” is synonymous with CSAM, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), which helps find and rescue missing and exploited children in the United States, considers “CSAM” the more appropriate term. NCMEC provides Apple and other technology firms with information on known CSAM images.

Apple introduced CSAM Detection along with several other features that expand parental controls on Apple mobile devices. For example, parents will receive a notification if someone sends their child a sexually explicit photo in Apple Messages.

The simultaneous unveiling of several technologies resulted in some confusion, and a lot of people got the sense that Apple was now going to monitor all users all the time. That’s not the case.

CSAM Detection rollout timeline

CSAM Detection will be part of the iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 mobile operating systems, which will become available to users of all current iPhones and iPads (iPhone 6S, fifth-generation iPad and later) this autumn. Although the function will theoretically be available on Apple mobile devices everywhere in the world, for now the system will work fully only in the United States.

How CSAM Detection will work

CSAM Detection works only in conjunction with iCloud Photos, which is the part of the iCloud service that uploads photos from a smartphone or tablet to Apple servers. It also makes them accessible on the user’s other devices.

If a user disables photo syncing in the settings, CSAM Detection stops working. Does that mean photos are compared with those in criminal databases only in the cloud? Not exactly. The system is deliberately complex; Apple is trying to guarantee a necessary level of privacy.

As Apple explains, CSAM Detection works by scanning photos on a device to determine whether they match photos in NCMEC’s or other similar organizations’ databases.

The detection method uses NeuralHash technology, which in essence creates digital identifiers, or hashes, for photos based on their contents. If a hash matches one in the database of known child-exploitation images, then the image and its hash are uploaded to Apple’s servers. Apple performs another check before officially registering the image.

Another component of the system, cryptographic technology called private set intersection, encrypts the results of the CSAM Detection scan such that Apple can decrypt them only if a series of criteria are met. In theory, that should prevent the system from being misused — that is, it should prevent a company employee from abusing the system or handing over images at the request of government agencies.

In an August 13 interview with the Wall Street Journal, Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, articulated the main safeguard for the private set intersection protocol: To alert Apple, 30 photos need to match images in the NCMEC database. As the diagram below shows, the private set intersection system will not allow the data set — information about the operation of CSAM Detection and the photos — to be decrypted until that threshold is reached. According to Apple, because the threshold for flagging an image is so high, a false match is very unlikely — a “one in a trillion chance.”

What happens when the system is alerted? An Apple employee manually checks the data, confirms the presence of child pornography, and notifies authorities. For now the system will work fully only in the United States, so the notification will go to NCMEC, which is sponsored by the US Department of Justice.

Problems with CSAM Detection

Potential criticism of Apple’s actions falls into two categories: questioning the company’s approach and scrutinizing the protocol’s vulnerabilities. At the moment, there is little concrete evidence that Apple made a technical error (an issue we will discuss in more detail below), although there has been no shortage of general complaints.

For example, the Electronic Frontier Foundation has described these issues in great detail. According to the EFF, by adding image scanning on the user side, Apple is essentially embedding a back door in users’ devices. The EFF has criticized the concept since as early as 2019.

Why is that a bad thing? Well, consider having a device on which the data is completely encrypted (as Apple asserts) that then begins reporting to outsiders about that content. At the moment the target is child pornography, leading to a common refrain, “If you’re not doing anything wrong, you have nothing to worry about,” but as long as such a mechanism exists, we cannot know that it won’t be applied to other content.

Ultimately, that criticism is political more than technological. The problem lies in the absence of a social contract that balances security and privacy. All of us, from bureaucrats, device makers, and software developers to human-rights activists and rank-and-file users — are trying to define that balance now.

Law-enforcement agencies complain that widespread encryption complicates collecting evidence and catching criminals, and that is understandable. Concerns about mass digital surveillance are also obvious. Opinions, including opinions about Apple’s policies and actions, are a dime a dozen.

Potential problems with implementing CSAM Detection

Once we move past ethical concerns, we hit some bumpy technological roads. Any program code produces new vulnerabilities. Never mind what governments might do; what if a cybercriminal took advantage of CSAM Detection’s vulnerabilities? When it comes to data encryption, the concern is natural and valid: If you weaken information protection, even if it’s with only good intentions, then anyone can exploit the weakness for other purposes.

An independent audit of the CSAM Detection code has just begun and could take a very long time. However, we have already learned a few things.

First, code that makes it possible to compare photos against a “model” has existed in iOS (and macOS) since version 14.3. It is entirely possible that the code will be part of CSAM Detection. Utilities for experimenting with a search algorithm for matching images have already found some collisions. For example, according to Apple’s NeuralHash algorithm, the two images below have the same hash:

If it is possible to pull out the database of hashes of illegal photos, then it is possible to create “innocent” images that trigger an alert, meaning Apple could receive enough false alerts to make CSAM Detection unsustainable. That is most likely why Apple separated the detection, with part of the algorithm working only on the server end.

There is also this analysis of Apple’s private set intersection protocol. The complaint is essentially that even before reaching the alert threshold, the PSI system transfers quite a bit of information to Apple’s servers. The article describes a scenario in which law-enforcement agencies request the data from Apple, and it suggests that even false alerts might lead to a visit from the police.

For now, the above are just initial tests of an external review of CSAM Detection. Their success will depend largely on the famously secretive company providing transparency into CSAM Detection’s workings — and in particular, its source code.

What CSAM Detection means for the average user

Modern devices are so complex that it is no easy feat to determine how secure they really are — that is, to what extent they live up to the maker’s promises. All most of us can do is trust — or distrust — the company based on its reputation.

However, it is important to remember this key point: CSAM Detection operates only if users upload photos to iCloud. Apple’s decision was deliberate and anticipated some of the objections to the technology. If you do not upload photos to the cloud, nothing will be sent anywhere.

You may remember the notorious conflict between Apple and the FBI in 2016, when the FBI asked Apple for help unlocking an iPhone 5C that belonged to a mass shooter in San Bernardino, California. The FBI wanted Apple to write software that would let the FBI get around the phone’s password protection.

The company, recognizing that complying could result in unlocking not only the shooter’s phone but also anyone’s phone, refused. The FBI backed off and ended up hacking the device with outside help, exploiting the software’s vulnerabilities, and Apple maintained its reputation as a company that fights for its customers’ rights.

However, the story isn’t quite that simple. Apple did hand over a copy of the data from iCloud. In fact, the company has access to practically any user data uploaded to the cloud. Some, such as Keychain passwords and payment information, is stored using end-to-end encryption, but most information is encrypted only for protection from unsanctioned access — that is, from a hack of the company’s servers. That means the company can decrypt the data.

The implications make for perhaps the most interesting plot twist in the story of CSAM Detection. The company could, for example, simply scan all of the images in iCloud Photos (as Facebook, Google, and many other cloud service providers do). Apple created a more elegant mechanism that would help it repel accusations of mass user surveillance, but instead, it drew even more criticism — for scanning users’ devices.

Ultimately, the hullabaloo hardly changes anything for the average user. If you are worried about protecting your data, you should look at any cloud service with a critical eye. Data you store only on your device is still safe. Apple’s recent actions have sown well-founded doubts. Whether the company will continue in this vein remains an open question."

Now a mass industry, ransomware even shows a division of labor, with some criminals writing malicious code and others selecting targets and using the code to infect them, earning a percentage of the ransom.

In the past couple of years, ransomers have focused increasingly on organizations, but that does not mean ordinary users are in the clear — people still get hit, sometimes even by accident. If you don’t want to lose your photos, documents, and other files, you cannot avoid picking up a few antiransomware skills and habits.

What is ransomware?

Ransomware is malware that searches a hard drive for user-valuable information (such as documents, tables, images, and databases) and encrypts everything it finds, locking the files. Next, the ransomware displays a message demanding payment to restore the data.

If the victim pays, one of several scenarios may play out:

Sometimes the attackers actually send the decryption key with instructions;

Some attackers simply take the victim’s money and vanish;

In some cases, the cybercriminals cannot recover the data even if they want to — some ransomware damages files irrevocably.

Ransomware can get onto your computer in a variety of ways. For example, you might plug in an infected flash drive or download something from a shady website. E-mails with dangerous attachments or links to malicious sites are the most common sources of infection. Perhaps the most unpleasant aspect of many ransomware programs is their ability to spread across devices on the same network. That means if your home desktop picks up malware, you can expect an attack on your laptop as well. And one piece of ransomware on a work device can bring all corporate communications to a standstill.

What to do if your data gets encrypted

If your data gets encrypted, don’t panic. It’s a bad situation, but you may still be able to recover your files:

Do not pay. Each ransom payment represents a financial contribution to malware development and a signal to the cybercriminals that the scheme is profitable. And it may not work — you may get nothing even if you comply.

Use the Crypto Sheriff service on the No More Ransom website to find out what malware has infected your drive. A decryptor may already exist for it, in which case you can use it to recover your data without spending a dime.

No More Ransom, which is supported by Europol and various anticybercrime companies, hosts dozens of decryptors.

If you’re unable to find a decryptor for the ransomware that attacked you, keep checking; one might be released any day.

How to stay safe from ransomware

Now that you know the enemy, it’s time to learn a few information hygiene rules that can help you avoid ransomware.

1. Make backups

Regularly save important files and documents to a cloud storage and to an external hard drive. You can limit photo backups to once a week or even every month, but be sure to back up important, current documents every few days or even daily. Backing up your files doesn’t have to be a chore: See our guide to automatic backup.

However you decide to back up your data, don’t delay. Having a backup in the event of a ransomware attack — or if the cat walks across the keyboard and deletes your report — means you don’t have to lose any work.

For a successful backup, don’t forget a few important rules:

Connect the backup hard drive only when you’re writing to or reading from it. Any drive connected to the computer at the time of a ransomware attack will be encrypted as well.

Protect access to cloud storage with a strong password and two-factor authentication.

2. Be careful with messages

E-mail attachments and infected websites are the most common hiding places for ransomware Trojans, so treat all unexpected e-mails and messages as potential sources of danger. What makes a message suspicious, though? It’s a gray area requiring consideration and judgment.

Make sure you know the sender. Treat content, attachments and links in e-mails from strangers with the utmost skepticism. This applies to messages in messaging apps, social networks, and forums as well. If you have any concerns, consign the message to your spam folder, especially if it promises unexpected payouts.

To encounter such messages less often, configure spam filtering and mail traffic scanning in your security solution.

If you receive a suspicious link or file that you weren’t expecting from someone you do know, contact them by phone or in another format; their account or mailbox may have been compromised.

3. Avoid suspicious websites

Not limiting themselves to links in e-mails, cybercriminals employ a formidable array of tricks to dupe victims into downloading malware. If clicking on a banner results in an unexpected Web resource appearing, or the screen prompting you to download something, close the page immediately. You are very likely seeing an infection attempt.

4. Update software in a timely manner

To penetrate devices, cybercriminals often exploit known vulnerabilities that developers have already patched. Anyone who doesn’t update their software regularly is at particular risk. Turn on automatic updates wherever possible, and regularly check for updates for apps that don’t update automatically.

5. Install a security solution

Modern security solutions can identify and block malware in real time. For example, Kaspersky Internet Security includes a range of tools to protect users against ransomware. Even in the unlikely event that a particularly cunning piece of malware makes it past file antivirus protection, it won’t be able to do much: Kaspersky Internet Security analyzes the actions of running apps and blocks attempts to encrypt files or rolls back the actions of malicious programs if they manage to damage any data."

Having an insider deliberately deploy malware seems implausible. However, as real-world evidence shows, some attackers think this method of delivering ransomware is effective, and some attackers are now recruiting company employees by offering them a percentage of the ransom.

A creative delivery scheme

As absurd as it may sound, some seek out accomplices through spam. For example, one message directly offers “40%, $1 million in bitcoin” to anyone willing to install and deploy DemonWare ransomware on their organization’s main Windows server.

Researchers masquerading as interested accomplices received a link to a file along with instructions for launching the malware. However, the person behind the mailing was apparently an inexperienced cybercriminal; the researchers had no trouble getting him to talk. The threat actor in question was a young Nigerian man who had scoured LinkedIn, looking for senior executives to contact. He abandoned his original plan — e-mailing malware — once he realized how strong corporate cybersecurity systems are.

What’s wrong with the scheme?

To convince his targets their participation would be safe, the threat actor claimed the ransomware would erase all evidence of the crime, including any potential security footage, and recommended deleting the executable file to avoid leaving any clues. One might expect the criminal planned to trick his accomplices — arguably, once the server was encrypted, he would not care what happened to the person who did it — but he doesn’t appear to have understood how digital forensics investigations work.

The decision to use DemonWare also betrayed his inexperience. Although attackers do still use DemonWare, it is actually rather unsophisticated malware whose source code is available on GitHub. The malware’s creator allegedly made it to demonstrate how easy it is to write ransomware.

How to stay safe

Although this example is just that — one specific example — insiders taking part in a ransomware attack is entirely realistic. Far more likely than someone launching malware on a network, however, is a scenario in which someone sells access to an organization’s information system.

The market for access to corporate networks has long existed on the dark web, and ransomers often purchase access from other cybercriminals — so-called Initial Access Brokers. It’s they who may be specifically interested in buying data for remote access to the organization’s network or cloud servers. Ads for such purchases aimed at disgruntled or fired employees float around the dark web.

To ensure no one jeopardizes your company’s security by letting ransomers into its networks, we recommend you:"

The Trojan, called Triada, downloads other malware to users’ devices. Here’s how it happened and why using modified versions of WhatsApp is dangerous.

Why use WhatsApp mods?

Not all users are happy with the official WhatsApp app. Some may feel a need for self-destructing messages or, conversely, the ability to view messages another user deleted. Others are after dynamic themes, and still others want to hide certain chats from the general list or automatically translate messages.

Naturally, they want these features right away, not when WhatsApp’s developers finally get around to implementing them. As a result, some users turn to the modified WhatsApp clients available online, which are fairly numerous and not hard to find.

Fans of mods are not deterred even by WhatsApp’s occasional crackdown on such modifications or the threat of account bans.

The creators of WhatsApp mods often embed ads in them — understandably — along with the features users are looking for. Problems arise, however, from their use of third-party ad modules through which malicious code can sneak in under developers’ radar.

Triada et al. in the FMWhatsApp mod

That’s precisely what happened with FMWhatsApp, a popular WhatsApp mod. In version 16.80.0 the developers use third-party ad module that includes a Trojan. Our mobile antivirus solution detects this malware as Trojan.AndroidOS.Triada.ef.

We saw a similar situation in the spring of 2021 with the APKPure unofficial app store, whose developers also used an ad module from an unverified source, thereby infecting their creation, and consequently users, with the Triada Trojan (albeit a slightly different version).

As in the case of the infected APKPure, the Triada Trojan in the dangerous version of the FMWhatsApp mod performs an intermediary function. First, it collects data about the user’s device, and then, depending on the information, it downloads another Trojan.

Triada’s “extras” come in a variety of flavors — the infected version of FMWhatsApp downloads several types of malware to devices:

Trojan-Downloader.AndroidOS.Agent.ic, a Trojan that downloads and runs other malicious modules;

Trojan-Downloader.AndroidOS.Gapac.e, which downloads and runs other malicious modules and can also display full-screen ads at unexpected moments;

Trojan-Downloader.AndroidOS.Helper.a, which downloads and runs the installer module of the xHelper Trojan and runs invisible ads in the background;

Trojan.AndroidOS.MobOk.i, a Trojan that signs up for paid subscriptions;

Trojan.AndroidOS.Subscriber.l, another Trojan that signs up for paid subscriptions;

Trojan.AndroidOS.Whatreg.b, the most complex Trojan in the list, signs in to the WhatsApp account on the victim’s phone, intercepting the login confirmation text. The device can then become a site for various types of illegal activity such as spam distribution or illegal trading.

Practicing caution and using your device safely is key to keeping malware and other mobile nasties off your phone. Generally speaking, follow these tips to avoid trouble:"

Here are some we’ve found over the past year.

Cyberattacks on gamers

Our experts took a look at how cybercriminals made money from gamers who skimped on both gaming and security, ending up with unexpected apps along with (or instead of) the games they thought they were downloading.

Want some ads?

Perhaps the most common surprise greedy gamers find in their popular games is adware. Although not usually too harmful, adware can be very annoying. With this uninvited guest on their computer or smartphone, users will constantly be closing banners, pop-up videos, and browser pages they didn’t open.

Cryptomining, a timeless threat

In the hierarchy of bad stuff users might get with pirated games, cryptominers rank far higher than adware. Gamers, with their souped-up computers and brawny video cards, make ideal targets for cryptocurrency freeloaders — and a miner concealed inside a game with high system requirements can go unnoticed for quite some time, during which the computer is working for a malicious third party.

Swarez: Danger at the top of search results

Most gamers know that the place to get official games is a specialized store such as Steam. But for a “Minecraft crack” or “virus-free FIFA,” they turn to search engines. Cybercriminals take advantage of this, creating websites offering free keys, cracks, and unlocked versions of games; adding Trojans; and pushing them onto the first page of search results. Alternatively, they can load infected, pirated copies onto existing warez sites.

That is how the Swarez loader gets distributed. Users who try to download, say, cracks for Minecraft get sent through a long chain of redirects to a page with a ZIP archive, inside of which is another password-protected ZIP and a text file with a key. Unzipping the archive loads Swarez on the unfortunate gamer’s device, where it proceeds to download Taurus spyware, a Trojan that takes screenshots and steals cryptowallets, desktop files, and passwords and other data stored in browsers.

Fake Minecraft targets Android users

Minecraft remains very popular cyberattack bait, including on smartphones and tablets. Back in 2020, we found more than 20 malicious apps on Google Play disguised as mods for the game, and this year saw a repeat.

The game also serves as a front for Hqwar malware, which reports an installation error and prompts the user to uninstall the app. In fact, that removes only the icon; the malware remains, working in stealth mode to harvest online bank credentials.

Vesub Trojan disguised as Brawl Stars and PUBG

Another example of cunning malware, Vesub, hides in pirated versions of Brawl Stars and PUBG for Android.

When run, the malware appears to load very slowly — and then, nothing. The victim, seeing the game is not working, quits. The icon disappears from the screen at that point, but the Trojan remains on the device and gets to work.

What’s actually happening during that fake startup is data collection: Vesub collects system data and receives further instructions. Then, running in the background, it can subscribe the victim to paid services, send text messages from their smartphone, play YouTube videos, visit app pages on Google Play, and open advertising websites.

And then there’s phishing

By now you should understand quite well that downloading pirated games is far more trouble than it’s worth. If so, your gaming experience just became a lot safer. However, you should know about another way cybercriminals exploit gamers’ quest for freebies: offering bundles of games at a 99% discount, promising mountains of free or near-free in-game currency, and inviting players to take part in nonexistent tournaments.

Hiding behind famous titles — from FIFA 21 and Apex Legends to GTA Online and Pokemon Go — cybercriminals scoop up victims’ e-mail addresses, social network names and login credentials, and game info. Even without passwords, such information fetches a price on the dark web. Need we state that by entering your password on an unofficial site, you run the risk of losing your account?

Even worse is if the victim, asked for payment card details for “verification,” agrees. What happens next, you know only too well.

How to get games risk-free

The risks gamers face are neither new nor particularly unusual. Although gamers appear to be a relatively risk-tolerant group, you can practice safe gaming by following some commonsense tips:"

Exploiting the human factor and making use of readily available contact info (such as for HR and PR staff), crooks can extract login credentials from unsuspecting employees without having to worry about those ever-improving cybersecurity solutions.

Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet to protect companies from phishing; the problem requires both organizational and technical measures. Here’s how to implement such protection in practice.

Protect your mail server

Browsers and some e-mail clients have their own security filters, but cybercriminals have many techniques to bypass them. Some, for example, use e-mail marketing services.

Preventing phishing e-mails from reaching employees’ mailboxes at all is a strong starting point. Use a security solution at the mail gateway level such as Kaspersky Security for Mail Server, which not only checks links in incoming mail, but also detects threats in sent files.

Protect Microsoft Office 365 services

These days, instead of deploying their own mail servers, many companies use cloud services, primarily MS Office 365. Microsoft Office account data, which potentially gives attackers access to services such as OneDrive and SharePoint that may store confidential information and contact details, is a frequent and unsurprising target of phishing attacks. Even if an employee knows in theory that they need to check messages carefully, they might still click a link or forward a message to colleagues if they’re in a hurry.

Microsoft has its own, imperfect security technologies, which you can — and should — strengthen with additional layers of protection. For example, Kaspersky Security for Microsoft Office 365 prevents the spread of threats through Office services, guards against spam and phishing, and removes malicious attachments.

Train employees

Today’s cybercriminal bag of tricks includes malicious links hidden in e-mails, attached Trojans disguised as documents, misleading text messages and phone calls, and more. Phishing messages can even come from a hosting provider or a partner company if one of its employees’ accounts is compromised. Employees must be aware of these schemes and be able to spot suspicious e-mails.

Staff cybersecurity awareness training can come from your own IT department or outside experts. Additionally, online tools such as Kaspersky Automated Security Awareness Platform help employees learn in a convenient, on-the-job format.

Send test phishing e-mails

Testing employees by sending them relevant phishing e-mails enables — or forces — employees to apply their knowledge in practice and prepare for real incidents. Testing also highlights people and areas in need of improvement.

Provide contact info for someone who can help check suspicious e-mails

After basic cybersecurity training, employees will be able to spot most phishing e-mails by noting visual cues such as unknown sender address, wrong company logo, and typos. In some cases, however, determining whether a message is safe may require the help of an expert. Include your company’s best contact for evaluating suspicious messages in the onboarding guide and prominently on the corporate portal.

Protect workstations

Even experienced and sharp-eyed employees make mistakes. Phishing links may appear in an employee’s personal e-mail or come in through a messaging app — channels your security systems do not control. Therefore, installing a security solution on every Internet-connected workstation is crucial. That way, even if a phishing link reaches the target and gets clicked, the redirect will be blocked.

Protect mobile devices

Employees use smartphones to view mail and financial documents, and they chat in messaging apps. Mobile devices have always posed a threat to corporate security, and do so even more in this era of mass remote work. To thwart phishing attacks on mobile devices, secure those devices as well, with Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Business, which protects both workstations and mobile phones.

Stay ahead of criminals

Phishers are forever coming up with new schemes, such that even the savviest pro might one day unwittingly hand over the keys to their mail or other account. With a few commonsense requirements, you can ensure cybercriminals get their hands on as little confidential information as possible.

Enable two-factor authentication

Turn on two-factor authentication for all online corporate services. With 2FA enabled, even if attackers discover the credentials for a corporate account or an e-mail password, they won’t be able to get in.

Require unique passwords

Instruct employees to use unique passwords for each work service or device. Then, even if phishers get one password, no other resources will be at risk.

Adhere to the principle of least privilege

If employees have access rights only to the servers, cloud storage, and other valuable assets that they truly need, cybercriminals will not be able to inflict too much damage, even if they gain control of a corporate account.

Action plan

By following these simple tips, you can protect your employees — and thus your business — from the phishing menace. In brief:"

What to do if your Instagram profile gets blockedIf you’re already the victim of a ban attack, contact Instagram support immediately with an explanation of what happened.
How to protect your Instagram profileUnfortunately, users tend to learn about a ban attack only after the fact.","If you run a popular blog and promote your business through Instagram, an account ban simply isn’t in the plan. For responsible users, the idea of being banned for, say, displaying suicidal content or trying to impersonate someone else might seem like a bad dream or a cruel joke, but it’s quite real for victims of the new wave of so-called ban attacks. Here’s how these attacks work, how to defend against them, and what to do if your account has been hit.

How cybercriminals block Instagram profiles

It’s all quite simple: Detractors or competitors can pay a fee (the amount depends on the seller or even the number of followers) to have your profile blocked.

Such attacks began last fall, but of late they’ve become particularly high-profile. Recently, online magazine Motherboard connected with a cybercriminal group and learned how they exploit Instagram’s policy to make money through ban-as-a-service offerings.

The group’s favored tactic is the fake impersonation complaint, which involves verified accounts, identifiable by the blue check next to the username. The attackers use verified accounts to create a full copy of the victim’s profile, right down to the avatar and description. Then they file a complaint against the original, accusing the owner of impersonation. If the victim’s account is not verified, the support service bans the victim.

The second blocking method is to inundate tech support with messages alleging that the victim’s profile contains images of suicide or self-mutilation. In many cases, Instagram takes the easier path, blocking accounts on the basis of such complaints without first checking their actual content.

Unlike phishing and other similar schemes that still require action from the victim — clicking a dangerous link, for example — a ban attack works with no victim participation whatsoever. The target, who might never even dream of violating the terms of use, simply finds their account blocked.

According to the Motherboard reporters, the service is inexpensive, running about $5 to $60, so the cybercriminals have no shortage of customers.

However, not all users who abuse Instagram’s moderation practices are in it to make money. Malicious scripts are freely available, and any online hooligan can use them to settle a personal score or silence a disagreeable blogger.

Instagram unblocking for a fee

In fact, blocking Instagram accounts opens up another money-generating avenue: restoring them. Unblocking carries a far higher fee than blocking — reportedly up to $3,500–$4,000.

Whether the same people are behind the banning and the unblocking services, or whether it’s an accidental symbiosis, remains unclear for now. Some users do receive an offer to reinstate their account just a few minutes after the blocking, however, and those offers often come from followers of the accounts from which the original complaints came.

What to do if your Instagram profile gets blocked

If you’re already the victim of a ban attack, contact Instagram support immediately with an explanation of what happened. Bans are appealable only through the app. To do so, you will need to enter your username and password, then follow the instructions.

If anyone comes knocking with an offer to restore your account for money, don’t pay! First, you have no guarantee that anything will come of it. Second, doing so supports confirmed miscreants — perhaps even the ones who got your account banned in the first place. Third, the official recovery procedure through Instagram support is free.

How to protect your Instagram profile

Unfortunately, users tend to learn about a ban attack only after the fact. Instagram told Motherboard that it plans to sniff out cybercriminal accounts on the platform, and asks users to report any suspicious activity, but that approach is time-consuming. In the meantime, we suggest you take some measures to protect yourself.

Verify your account

The ban-attack business centers on accusations of impersonation, so the best way to protect yourself is to convince Instagram that you are you before anything happens. In other words, you should verify your account now.

The social network won’t check every user, but you may have some points in your favor. For example, if you or your business has been mentioned in multiple news sources, that helps. To get the coveted blue check mark, you’ll want to complete your profile and delete any old accounts to avoid arousing suspicion. Naturally, the account must also be public and not violate Instagram’s terms of use.

Once you’ve ensured your account is ready, send a verification request. You can do it directly through the app:

Go to your profile settings;

Select Account;

Select Request Verification;

Enter your full name and attach required documentation;

Follow the subsequent instructions.

Make your account private

What if you’re not famous enough to pass blue-check verification? You can take the radical step of closing your account to the public. If you make your account private, then your posts, photos, and videos will be available only to subscribers, which means that an attacker won’t be able to copy them and accuse you of impersonation.

Whether in the app or a browser, it is not difficult to make your account private. See our post on setting up Instagram security and privacy for detailed instructions.

Be sure to take the trouble to clean up your list of followers as well, and check future follower requests before accepting them. Bots and other barely there accounts can hide attackers, and you’re under no obligation to let them in.

Change your profile pic

For business profiles that you cannot close but that aren’t well-known enough for verification — or that you feel you must keep open for any other reason — there’s another way to reduce the risk of ban attacks: Change your avatar.

Fake impersonation complaints work best on profiles with a real photo of the owner. Some underground ban-attack services even refuse to target accounts with other avatars. That means putting up something that isn’t your portrait complicates attempts to do harm; every bit helps.

Maintain a backup and update contact information

Instagram admins do what they can to combat wrongful complaints, but they’re working against cybercriminals who continually improve their money-making schemes. In a perfect world you wouldn’t have to, but here and now, you should prepare an escape route.

First, make sure you have access to the e-mail address and phone number linked to your profile. If your account is wrongfully blocked, you can use them for recovery.

Second, save your content regularly. That way, if worse comes to worst, you can use it to migrate to a new account."

How to secure Linux serversKaspersky Endpoint Security for Linux has long protected users from such problems.
We are also aware that a significant share of Linux machines are cloud servers, not physical machines running in clients’ offices.","Until recently, large swaths of the IT community were convinced that Linux machines didn’t need protection — that the system’s architecture, being intrinsically near invulnerable, held no interest for attackers, and the very ideology of open-source code served as a kind of guarantee against unexpected, serious vulnerabilities. In recent years, however, even hardheaded infosec officers have come to realize such statements have little basis in fact.

Threats to Linux servers

As long as cybercrime was focused solely on making money at end users’ expense, Linux servers were indeed relatively safe. But modern cybercriminals set their sights on business, with its greater potential for much bigger payouts, long ago. And that is where the various Linux builds have come under serious scrutiny. After all, a server is of strategic interest to any attacker regardless of purpose, be it espionage, sabotage, or ordinary ransomware distribution. You don’t have to look far or wide for examples.

Last November, our experts found a modification of the RansomEXX Trojan that could encrypt data on Linux machines. Tailored for targeted attacks on specific organizations (the code and ransom note are customized for each new target), the Trojan was already in use at the time of discovery.

DarkRadiation ransomware, detected this summer, is purpose-built for attacks on Red Hat/CentOS and Debian Linux, and it can stop all Docker containers on affected machines. The malware is written entirely in a Bash script, and it uses a Telegram messenger API to communicate with C&C servers.

Almost every modern APT group has backdoors, rootkits, or exploit code for Linux. Our Global Research & Analysis Team (GReAT) published a study of the latest APT tools targeting Linux machines.

Although the open-source community carefully studies distributions, collectively discusses vulnerabilities, and releases information about them responsibly (most of the time), administrators don’t always update their Linux servers. Many still figure, “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”

That philosophy prevails despite some vulnerabilities being quite serious. For example, cybercriminals can use CVE-2021-3560, found in the polkit system service (installed by default in many Linux distributions) and published in June of 2021, for privilege escalation. The vulnerability received a score of 7.8 out of 10 on the CVSS v3 scale.

How to secure Linux servers

Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Linux has long protected users from such problems. However, with the rising number of attacks on servers running on Linux, we decided to update our solution with a number of new technologies.

First, the solution now features full Application Control (a technology for running only those applications in the trusted list, or blocking those in the untrusted list). To help users configure this module, we added features to inventory executable programs and define custom categories. That ensures highly effective protection against a very wide range of threats. Second, the time had come to strengthen the system’s antiransomware capability (malware of this type is now detected by its behavior).

We are also aware that a significant share of Linux machines are cloud servers, not physical machines running in clients’ offices. Moreover, thanks to the development of containerization technologies, it is now possible to run applications in containers, enabling admins to solve scalability issues, increasing application stability, and improving computing resource efficiency. Therefore, we focused on scenarios for deploying the solution in public clouds and protecting containerization platforms (Docker, Podman, Cri-O, and Runc). Those apply to both threat detection mode for launched containers, enabling techs to identify particular containers containing threats and specifying paths to malicious files (in a runtime environment), and as a service for checking container images on demand (both local and located in repositories). In the latter scenario, it is possible to launch Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Linux inside a Docker container and use it to scan other containers for threats using the RESTful API, which serves to automate the tasks of scanning container images, for example, in the CI/CD pipeline.

Users now have more than one option for managing the protection of servers and container loads in public clouds such as Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, and Yandex Cloud. The first is through the console, whether in an in-house data center or in a public cloud. The second is through the Kaspersky Security Center Cloud Console, deployed and supported by us, leaving the administrator free to focus on managing the protection of their infrastructure.

Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Linux is part of the Kaspersky Hybrid Cloud solutions suite. It integrates with the Kaspersky Managed Detection and Response service, which handles the particularly dangerous cyberthreats that can bypass automatic barriers."

Accenture employs more than a third of the 15,000 people whom Facebook has said it has hired to inspect its posts. And while the agreements provide only a small fraction of Accenture’s annual revenue, they give it an important lifeline into Silicon Valley. Within Accenture, Facebook is known as a “diamond client.”

Their contracts, which have not previously been reported, have redefined the traditional boundaries of an outsourcing relationship. Accenture has absorbed the worst facets of moderating content and made Facebook’s content issues its own. As a cost of doing business, it has dealt with workers’ mental health issues from reviewing the posts. It has grappled with labor activism when those workers pushed for more pay and benefits. And it has silently borne public scrutiny when they have spoken out against the work.

Those issues have been compounded by Facebook’s demanding hiring targets and performance goals and so many shifts in its content policies that Accenture struggled to keep up, 15 current and former employees said. And when faced with legal action from moderators about the work, Accenture stayed quiet as Facebook argued that it was not liable because the workers belonged to Accenture and others.

“You couldn’t have Facebook as we know it today without Accenture,” said Cori Crider, a co-founder of Foxglove, a law firm that represents content moderators. “Enablers like Accenture, for eye-watering fees, have let Facebook hold the core human problem of its business at arm’s length.”

The Times interviewed more than 40 current and former Accenture and Facebook employees, labor lawyers and others about the companies’ relationship, which also includes accounting and advertising work. Most spoke anonymously because of nondisclosure agreements and fear of reprisal. The Times also reviewed Facebook and Accenture documents, legal records and regulatory filings.

Facebook and Accenture declined to make executives available for comment. Drew Pusateri, a Facebook spokesman, said the company was aware that content moderation “jobs can be difficult, which is why we work closely with our partners to constantly evaluate how to best support these teams.”

Stacey Jones, an Accenture spokeswoman, said the work was a public service that was “essential to protecting our society by keeping the internet safe.”"

The settlement of the lawsuit was complex, and various people in the tech industry had widely different reactions to it. Apple and the people who sued it framed the deal as a major concession from Apple and a victory for developers. Some of Apple’s critics, including companies that pay it millions of dollars in app fees, called it a “sham” that did little to change Apple’s control over apps.

Here is an explanation of the settlement and what it means.

First of all, what is the controversy all about?

Courts, regulators, lawmakers and developers have been scrutinizing Apple’s practice of collecting a commission of up to 30 percent on the sales of other companies in its App Store, a business that generates, according to some estimates, nearly $20 billion a year for Apple.

Many companies that reach their customers through apps don’t want to pay Apple a hefty cut, and they are increasingly fighting to change the rules. Apple argues that its commission rewards it for creating the “economic miracle” of the App Store, and it is fighting to keep the status quo."

Ultimately (spoiler alert), Chalice herself has to decide whether to take control of her life.

There’s a direct line from Cheng’s Whole Foods epiphany to “Life After BOB,” starting with a series of works that bore some variation of the title “Entropy Wrangler” and were made using Unity, a software “engine” designed to simplify the task of video game development. Unity enabled him to simulate the kind of behavior he’d seen unfolding at Whole Foods — except that instead of people wandering around a market, now he was able to throw together potted plants, cinder blocks, a disembodied hand, a broken-down office chair, and assorted other stuff in a state of constant, endless, frenetic motion, never stopping, never looping back. “Entropy Wrangler” was a real-time animation in which the same thing never happened twice.

Later Cheng introduced characters into his animations, and gave them an objective. The first of this series, “Emissary in the Squat of Gods,” centers on a young girl who lives in a primitive community on the slopes of a long-dormant volcano. She realizes that the volcano might be about to blow — but will the villagers pay heed? (Sometimes they do, and sometimes they don’t.)"

And in one way or another, it has been testing the authorities ever since.

When a venture capital firm invested $3 million in the company in 2012, Didi lacked several of the state-issued licenses it needed to do business, two people familiar with the matter said. When Beijing, Shanghai and other big cities began requiring that drivers for ride-hailing platforms be local residents, Didi protested. Today, the company acknowledges that many rides are still being provided by drivers and vehicles that don’t meet local requirements.

And when China’s government demanded that ride-hailing services share real-time trip data for safety purposes, Didi dragged its feet, citing privacy concerns — until the rapes and murders of two female passengers finally pushed the company to relent.

He called it “a wonderful and most beautiful spectacle.” As far as the eye could see, he added, “the crest of every wave was bright” — so much so that the “livid flames” lit the sky.

Last year, the company said it would bar the purchase of new political ads the week before the election, then later decided to temporarily ban all U.S. political advertising after the polls closed on Election Day, causing an uproar among candidates and ad-buying firms.

The company has struggled with how to handle lies and hate speech around elections. During his last year in office, Mr. Trump used Facebook to suggest he would use state violence against protesters in Minneapolis ahead of the 2020 election, while casting doubt on the electoral process as votes were tallied in November. Facebook initially said that what political leaders posted was newsworthy and should not be touched, before later reversing course.

The social network has also faced difficulties in elections elsewhere, including the proliferation of targeted disinformation across its WhatsApp messaging service during the Brazilian presidential election in 2018. In 2019, Facebook removed hundreds of misleading pages and accounts associated with political parties in India ahead of the country’s national elections.

Facebook has tried various methods to stem the criticisms. It established a political ads library to increase transparency around buyers of those promotions. It also has set up war rooms to monitor elections for disinformation to prevent interference.

There are several elections in the coming year in countries such as Hungary, Germany, Brazil and the Philippines where Facebook’s actions will be closely scrutinized. Voter fraud misinformation has already begun spreading ahead of German elections in September. In the Philippines, Facebook has removed networks of fake accounts that support President Rodrigo Duterte, who used the social network to gain power in 2016.

“There is already this perception that Facebook, an American social media company, is going in and tilting elections of other countries through its platform,” said Nathaniel Persily, a law professor at Stanford University. “Whatever decisions Facebook makes have global implications.”

voting machines, which eliminated paper ballots altogether.
Additionally, Dominion developed a tabulator that kept a digital image of the paper ballots so they could be easily audited.
(They also sold machines that met the needs of visually impaired voters, with audio interfaces and headphones that allowed for independence and anonymity.)","Coomer watched the video in shock. He is adamant that he never participated in any antifa phone call, and he felt disgusted by the accusation that he had done anything to change the results of the election. The Trump campaign and its allies have introduced more than 60 lawsuits claiming election fraud in this country, but no court has found persuasive evidence to support the idea that Coomer, Dominion or anyone else involved in vote-counting changed the election results. Bipartisan audits of paper ballots in closely contested states such as Georgia and Arizona confirmed Biden’s victory; and prominent Republicans, including Attorney General Bill Barr and Trump’s official in charge of election cybersecurity, have reaffirmed the basic facts of the election: Over all, the results were accurate, the election process was secure and no widespread fraud capable of changing the outcome has been uncovered.

Oltmann is now the subject of a defamation suit brought by Coomer. It currently names, as co-defendants, 14 parties responsible for the dissemination of Oltmann’s claims about that alleged antifa phone call, including Sidney Powell, Rudy Giuliani and the Trump campaign. (Dominion has filed separate defamation suits against Giuliani, Powell, Fox News and others. Lawyers for Giuliani, Powell and for the Trump campaign declined to comment. Fox called the Dominion litigation “baseless” and defended its right to tell “both sides” of the story.) Oltmann’s best defense would be to provide corroboration of his claims about that phone call — he has said there were as many as 19 people on the line — but he has so far declined to do so.

As Coomer watched the video, though, he felt a second strong emotion: a powerful sense of regret — because the Facebook posts were, in fact, authentic. Why, he thought, hadn’t he just deleted them? Coomer could imagine how his words would sound to just about any Republican, let alone someone already hearing on Fox News that Dominion was switching votes for Biden. He told me that he believed every word of what he said on Facebook, but when colleagues later asked him what he was thinking, he was frank: He had screwed up. At a time when well-​funded efforts to sow mistrust in the election were already underway, Coomer had given conspiracy theorists a valuable resource, a grain of sand they could transform into something that had the feel — the false promise — of proof.

Elections in the United States are impossibly convoluted. Every county — and, in some states, every municipality — runs its own election, creating a patchwork system in which voters in one place may have a remarkably different voting process from their neighbors just a few miles away. That variation can breed mistrust: If voters in one county believe their election process is being administered correctly, different methods in other counties might strike them as suspect.

Local governments also rely on private companies like Dominion and its competitors ES&S and Hart InterCivic, which together control 90 percent of the voting-machine market, to provide machines, software and technical support. For Americans who are suspicious about an election result — or are looking to create suspicions — these relatively obscure, private companies present an obvious target. In 2004, after George W. Bush narrowly won the presidency, Democrats focused on possible irregularities in Ohio, whose 20 electoral votes would have given the presidency to John Kerry. The voting machines used in Ohio that year came from Diebold, whose chief executive, Walden O’Dell, was a longtime Republican donor. A year before the election, O’Dell wrote a letter to about 100 people inviting them to a fund-raiser: “I am committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president next year,” he wrote. The language reinforced mistrust of Diebold machines among some Democrats. O’Dell later said the letter was a “huge mistake,” and Diebold ultimately sold its voting-machine business.

Dominion was founded in the wake of a different controversy: the failure of punch-card voting machines — and their infamous hanging chads — in the 2000 election. After Congress funded a bill to replace those machines, many counties purchased direct-recording electronic (D.R.E.) voting machines, which eliminated paper ballots altogether. The limits of that approach became apparent in 2006, when, in Sarasota, Fla., a Congressional race that used D.R.E. machines made by ES&S produced a result that struck partisans and neutral observers as unlikely. ES&S stood by the results, but in the absence of a paper ballot, doubts and uncertainty lingered.

Dominion was well-positioned at that moment. John Poulos, the company’s chief executive and one of its founders, started the business in 2003, serving a small circle of clients who favored a paper ballot. Additionally, Dominion developed a tabulator that kept a digital image of the paper ballots so they could be easily audited. (They also sold machines that met the needs of visually impaired voters, with audio interfaces and headphones that allowed for independence and anonymity.)"

Introduction

I've been reading Nicole Perlroth's new book This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends. Her discussion of the group formerly known as Tailored Access Operations, or TAO, reminded me of a controversy that arose in the 2000s. I had heard through back channels that some members of that group were upset that I was operating using the name TaoSecurity. In the 2000s and early 2010s I taught classes under the TaoSecurity brand, and even ran TaoSecurity as a single-person consultancy from 2005-2007.

The purpose of this post is to explain why, how, and when I chose the TaoSecurity identity, and to show that it is contemporaneous with the formal naming of the TAO group. The most reliable accounts indicate TaoSecurity predates the TAO brand.

TaoSecurity Began with Kung Fu and Taoism

With Sifu Michael Macaris, 21 June 1996

In the summer of 1994, after graduating from the Air Force Academy and before beginning my graduate program at what is now called the Harvard Kennedy School, I started watching re-runs of the 1970s David Carradine Kung Fu TV series, created by Ed Spielman. I was so motivated by the philosophical message of the program that I joined a kung fu school in Massachusetts. I trained there for two years, and studied what I could about Chinese history and culture. I learned from the show and that it was based on Taoism (for example) so I bought a copy of the Tao Te Ching by Lao Tzu and devoured it.

Visiting China

Tai Chi on the Yangtze, May 1999

In the spring of 1999 my wife and I took a three week trip to China for our honeymoon. We were both interested in Chinese culture so it seemed like a great opportunity. It was an amazing trip, despite the fact that we were in China when the United States bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.

I include these details to show that I was quite the fan of Chinese culture, well before any formal cyber threat intelligence reports associated me with China. I read books on Taoism and embraced its concepts.

Creating TaoSecurity

WHOIS lookup for taosecurity.com

In the summer of 2000 I was a captain at the Air Force Computer Emergency Response Team, within the 33rd Information Operations Squadron. I decided I wanted to try creating a Web presence, so I registered the TaoSecurity domain name on 4 July 2000. The WHOIS record above shows 3 July, which is odd, because a previous post on the topic captured the correct date of 4 July 2000. I also coined the phrase ""the way of digital security.""

My wife commissioned an artist to design the TaoSecurity logo, which I have used continuously since then. At the time I had never heard of TAO. There was a good reason for that. TAO was just being born as well.

General Hayden on Creating TAO





Playing to the Edge by General Michael Hayden

The first public source on the history of TAO appeared in a 2013 story for Foreign Policy by Matthew M. Aid . He claimed that the agency created TAO in 1997. While it is possible that members of what would later be named TAO were working a similar mission in 1997, his story requires details that I add next.

A succinct source on the origins of the unit previously known as the TAO is the 18 October 2018 article by Steven Loleski. He wrote a piece called From cold to cyber warriors: the origins and expansion of NSA’s Tailored Access Operations (TAO) to Shadow Brokers (PDF). Mr. Loleski cited General Michael Hayden's 2016 book Playing to the Edge, which I quote more extensively here:

""In the last days of 2000, as we were rewiring the entire agency’s organizational chart (see chapter 2), we set up an enterprise called TAO, Tailored Access Operations, in the newly formed SIGINT Directorate (SID). We had toyed with some boutique end-point efforts before, but this was different. This was going to be industrial strength...And, even in a period of generalized growth, TAO became the fastest-growing part of NSA post-9/11, bar none.""

Seeing as General Hayden was in charge of NSA at the time, that would seem to make it clear that TaoSecurity preceded TAO by several months, at least.

I also looked for details in the 2016 book Dark Territory: The Secret History of Cyber War by Fred Kaplan. I've enjoyed several of his previous books, and he interviewed and cited me for the text.

Mr. Kaplan explained how General Michael Hayden, NSA director from March 1999 to April 2005, named the unit, as part of a general reorganization effort. Thanks to Cryptome and FOIA requests by Inside Defense we can read the October 1999 report recommending organizational changes. That reorganization was the genesis for creating TAO.

Kaplan on Creating TAO

External Team Report Recommended Organization, 22 October 1999, Cryptome

This document, titled EXTERNAL TEAM REPORT: A Management Review for the Director, NSA, October 22, 1999 mentions the need to reorganize the ""Signals Intelligence Mission (SIM)"" into ""three offices, Global Response, Tailored Access and Global Network."" The October 2000 public news story by Inside Defense about the reorganization implies that it did not happen overnight.

Mr. Kaplan notes that General Hayden initiated his ""One Hundred Days of Change"" program on 15 November 1999. A three-day server crash in January 2000 hampered reform efforts, prompting big changes in NSA approaches to computing. However, TAO was eventually operating some time in 2000. Mr. Kaplan notes the following in his book:

""It began, even under his expansion, as a small outfit: a few dozen computer programmers who had to pass an absurdly difficult exam to get in. The organization soon grew into an elite corps as secretive and walled off from the rest of the NSA as the NSA was from the rest of the defense establishment. Located in a separate wing of Fort Meade, it was the subject of whispered rumors, but little solid knowledge, even among those with otherwise high security clearances...

Early on, TAO hacked into computers in fairly simple ways: phishing for passwords (one such program tried out every word in the dictionary, along with variations and numbers, in a fraction of a second) or sending emails with alluring attachments, which would download malware when opened.

Once, some analysts from the Pentagon’s Joint Task Force-Computer Network Operations were invited to Fort Meade for a look at TAO’s bag of tricks. The analysts laughed: this wasn’t much different from the software they’d seen at the latest DEF CON Hacking Conference; some of it seemed to be repackaged versions of the same software. Gradually, though, the TAO teams sharpened their skills and their arsenal.""

It's clear from this passage that TAO started as a small unit that conducted less exotic operations. It was difficult to join, but a far cry from the powerhouse it would soon become. It's also clear that knowledge of this organization was tightly controlled. Even the term ""tailored access"" was not associated publicly with NSA until the October 2000 reporting by Inside Defense, reproduced by Cryptome.

Minihan's Role

Dark Territory by Fred Kaplan

Circling back to the mention of 1997 in Mr. Aid's article, we do find the following in Mr. Kaplan's reporting:

""Fort Meade’s would be the third box on the new SIGINT organizational chart—“tailored access.”

[Lt Gen Kenneth] Minihan [NSA director 1996-1999] had coined the phrase. During his tenure as director, he pooled a couple dozen of the most creative SIGINT operators into their own corner on the main floor and gave them that mission. What CIA black-bag operatives had long been doing in the physical world, the tailored access crew would now do in cyberspace, sometimes in tandem with the black-baggers, if the latter were needed—as they had been in Belgrade—to install some device on a crucial piece of hardware.

The setup transformed the concept of signals intelligence, the NSA’s stock in trade. SIGINT had long been defined as passively collecting stray electrons in the ether; now, it would also involve actively breaking and entering into digital machines and networks.

Minihan had wanted to expand the tailored access shop into an A Group of the digital era, but he ran out of time. When Hayden launched his reorganization, he took the baton and turned it into a distinct, elite organization—the Office of Tailored Access Operations, or TAO.""

This reporting indicates that there was a tailored access group operating at NSA prior to General Hayden, but it was not actually named ""TAO"" and was not as large or exotic as what was to come.

Conclusion

""Tao inside,"" TAO's play on the Intel Inside marketing campaign

To summarize, General Hayden assigned the name TAO to a group inside NSA in late 2000, months after I registered the TaoSecurity domain name. Although General Minihan had created a tailored access group during his tenure, the existence of that team, as well as what was later formally called TAO, was a close-held secret. The term ""tailored access"" did not appear in the public until Inside Defense's reporting of October 2000.

Although I worked in the unit (Air Intelligence Agency) that served as the cryptologic service group for NSA (the Air Force contribution to the agency), I was not aware of any tailored access teams when I chose TaoSecurity as the name for my repository of security ideas. I selected TaoSecurity to reflect my interest in Taoism, and it had nothing to do with TAO or the NSA."

Proposition

Digital offense capabilities are currently net negative for the security ecosystem.[0]





The costs of improved digital offense currently outweigh the benefits. The legitimate benefits of digital offense accrue primarily to the security one percent #securityonepercent ), and to intelligence, military, and law enforcement agencies. The derived defensive benefits depend on the nature of the defender. The entire security ecosystem bears the costs, and in some cases even those who see tangible benefit may suffer costs exceeding those benefits.





The Reason

Limitations of scaling are the reason why digital offense capabilities are currently net negative.





Consider the case of an actor developing a digital offense capability, and publishing it to the general public.





From the target side, limitations on scaling prevent complete mitigation or remediation of the vulnerability.





The situation is much different from the offense perspective.





Any actor may leverage the offense capability against any Internet-connected target on the planet.





The actor can scale that capability across the entire range of vulnerable or exposed targets.





The Three

Only three sets of actors are able to possibly leverage an offense capability for defensive purposes.





First, the organization responsible for developing and maintaining the vulnerable or exposed asset can determine if there is a remedy for the new offense capability. (This is typically a ""vendor,"" but could be a noncommercial entity. As a shorthand, I will use ""vendor."") The vendor can try to develop and deploy a patch or mitigation method.





Second, major consumers of the vulnerable or exposed asset can take similar steps, usually by implementing the vendor's patch or mitigation.





Third, the security one percent can take some defensive measures, either by implementing the vendor's patch or mitigation, or by developing and acting upon detection and response processes.





The combination of the actions by these three sets of actors will not completely remediate the digital offense capability. The gap can be small, or it can be exceptionally large, hence the net negative cost to the digital ecosystem.





The Insight

From the intruder side, little to no limitations on scaling mean the intruder can leverage the digital offense capability against all vulnerable targets.





This is the key insight that produces digital offense capabilities as net negative for the entire security ecosystem:





Offensive scale is superior to defensive scale.





Stated differently:





An intruder actor can leverage an offense capability against any vulnerable target.





Few (if any) defenders can leverage a derived defense capability against all vulnerable targets.





Those who object to this argument are likely one of the three actors.





Objections: Vendors





Vendors may have the strongest case for being able to scale defense, depending on the nature of the vendor's offering.





Vendors who provide software or other capabilities that require customer action for updates are in the weakest position. If customers do not update, they remain vulnerable.





Vendors who mandate automatic updating are in a stronger position. Customers receive the update, with the effectiveness of the update mechanism being the major limitation.





Vendors who operate ""as a service"" offerings, such as the major cloud and email providers, are in the strongest position. They can silently improve their offering without user involvement. They can scale defense across their service as they more or less completely control it.





Objections: Major Consumers





Major consumers may operate with or without the involvement or action of vendors. When the major consumer is operating an on-premise instance, for example, they can be in a position to implement a mitigation or remediation. Such major consumers have teams that qualify them as being in the security one percent, so in some ways this dual-counts the defensive benefit.





Some major consumers may remain vulnerable, however, regardless of their relative size or nature. The SolarWinds case has shown that organizations with multi-billion-dollar information technology budgets can be as helpless as those outside the security one percent.





Objections: The Security One Percent

The security one percent is likely to voice the loudest objections. The security one percent are individuals working in entities with the budget to fund a blue (defense) team, and probably a red (offense) team.





As mentioned in a previous blog post , the security one percent can use offensive tools to equip their red or penetration testing teams. Those teams, nonexistent outside the security one percent, can work with or against blues team to determine if countermeasures are effective.





The security one percent is generally oblivious to their privilege. I was personally not aware of this mindset until the rise of ransomware in 2018-2020.





The exceptions are two-fold. One group who is aware of their privilege comes from ""the other side of the tracks."" They worked for an entity without a security team, perhaps in a non-IT role, or a non-security role. Another exception involves people who volunteer or consult with entities outside the security one percent. They see the gap between their own capabilities and those they are trying to help.





One portion of the security one percent is particularly critical: those who rely upon offense for their income, or enjoy it as a hobby. They reject any sentiment or policy prescription that threatens their livelihood or enjoyment, regardless of the larger societal cost. Addressing the concerns of this group requires a separate blog post.





Summary

The difference in the capabilities of the vendor/major consumer/security one percent triad and the rest of the security ecosystem is the result of defense failing to scale as effectively as offense.





When an actor publicly releases a digital offensive capability, especially in the form of working code, generally any threat actor can leverage that capability against any vulnerable target.





The inverse is not true. Any defensive capability, derived from the offensive capability, can generally not be leveraged to protect any vulnerable target.





Free or open source tools, training, or knowledge are helpful, but they require deployment, tuning, comprehension, commitment, and a host of other capabilities that do not scale as effectively as offensive code. While using offensive code has a learning and operational curve, it is nowhere as steep as that facing defenders.





The strongest and most helpful exception is found in vendors who offer ""as a service"" capabilities. They can independently and comprehensively improve their security posture with little to no involvement from the vulnerable population. (An exception, for example, is offering, but not mandating, multi-factor authentication. Only by adopting MFA does the population improve its security.)

Conclusion

The summary yields three conclusions:





1. Limiting the availability of digital offense capabilities, such that they are not public and within the reach of any threat actor, will likely limit offensive options for intruders, thereby increasing their operational costs to research, develop, deploy, and maintain offensive tools.





2. Increasing the use and reliance upon ""as a service"" offerings will likely improve the security of the ecosystem, as defensive measures can be scaled across the entire vulnerable population.





3. The rise of ""as a service"" offerings will likely drive intruders to target those offerings directly, rather than the independent assets distributed across the ecosystem.





There are no ""solutions"" in digital security -- only trade-offs.[1]





I am cautiously optimistic that some combination of the first two conclusions would offset the rise of the third conclusion, generating a net positive improvement in digital security.





Too many in the digital world have treated security as a technical problem with technical solutions. While technical matters play a role, the centrality of the digital ecosystem means that it should be treated as a public policy concern. That strategy is at least two decades overdue.

Introduction





I published a new book!









I also published a print edition , which is 485 pages.





Book Description





The book features the following description on the back cover:





Since 2003, cybersecurity author Richard Bejtlich has been publishing posts on TaoSecurity Blog, a site with 15 million views since 2011. Now, after re-reading over 3,000 stories and approximately one million words, he has selected and republished the very best entries from 17 years of writing, along with commentaries and additional material.

In the third volume of the TaoSecurity Blog series, Mr. Bejtlich addresses the evolution of his security mindset, influenced by current events and advice from his so-called set of ""wise people."" He talks about why speed is not the key to John Boyd's OODA loop, and why security strategies designed for and by the ""security 1%"" may be irrelevant at best, or harmful at worst, for the remaining ""99%"". His history section explores the origins of the terms threat hunting and indicators of compromise, and reveals who really created the quote ""there are two types of companies."" His chapter on law highlights traps that might catch security teams, with advice to chief information security officers.

This volume contains some of Mr. Bejtlich’s favorite posts, such as Marcus Ranum's answer to what happens when security teams confront professionals, or how the Internet continues to function despite constant challenges, or reactions to comments by Dan Geer, Bruce Schneier, Marty Roesch, and other security leaders. Mr. Bejtlich has written new commentaries to accompany each post, some of which would qualify as blog entries in their own right. Read how the security industry, defensive methodologies, and strategies to improve national security have evolved in this new book, written by one of the authors who has seen it all and survived to blog about it.



Writing the Series





Although I had written and self-published a book in early 2019 , I had used Blurb and stayed in print format.





For this new project, I wanted to publish ""reflowable"" (not print replica) Kindle editions, along with print versions, through Amazon.





I started the project in September 2019 by labelling 300 or so out of the 3,050 blog posts as candidates for inclusion in a ""best of"" book. I quickly realized that ""only"" 300 posts, plus new material and commentary, would result in a very large project, so I decided to break it into three volumes.





I created twelve categories and began sorting and commenting on the posts in March 2020. I decided to assign four categories to each volume, with an ""appendices"" category for the last volume if necessary.





I chose the 5.5 inch by 8.5 inch ""statement"" print size since it was supported by Google Docs and was a standard print size for Amazon.





Eventually I selected almost 375 posts for the book and began the real work!





I published volume 1 in May 2020. The print edition features 85,030 words in 357 pages, or about 238 words per page.



I published volume 2 in September 2020. The print edition features 96,288 words in 429 pages, or about 224 words per page

Now, volume 3 has arrived in November 2020. The print edition features 90,190 words in 485 pages, or about 185 words per page.

In total, the project resulted in 271,508 words over 1,271 pages, or about 214 words per page.





What's Next?









Originally I wanted to add a few items outside TaoSecurity Blog to the third volume, in a section called ""Appendices."" As I discovered and collected this material, I realized that adding it would essentially double the size of the third volume. As it was over 400 pages at that time, I decided I would save most of this material for another project.





That other project is Beyond TaoSecurity Blog, Volume 1: Columns, Papers, PhD Work, and Testimonies. At the moment, I believe I have a handle on what to include in that title. I don't expect to have a volume 2, but I thought it best to give this a volume number as I may have more material to publish in the future.





My goal is to publish this ""Beyond"" book during the next few weeks -- perhaps during or after Thanksgiving.





Conclusion





I wrote this series of books because I fear that this blog has become too unwieldy for its own good. Revisiting 17 years of posts, adding commentaries, and collecting related material has helped me better understand my own journey in security. The new ""Beyond"" book reaches a bit farther past the three blog volumes and includes material never before published, primarily from my abandoned PhD effort. I'll have more to say when I published that book before the end of the year.

Introduction





This post will estimate the size of the security 1% in the United States. It will then briefly explain how the security strategies of the 1% might be irrelevant at best or damaging at worse to the 99%.





A First Cut with FIRST





It's difficult to measure the size of the security 1%, but not impossible. My goal is to ascertain the correct orders of magnitude.





One method is to review entities who are members of the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams, or FIRST . FIRST is an organization to which high-performing computer incident response teams (CIRTs) may apply once their processes and data handling meet standards set by FIRST.





I learned of FIRST when the AFCERT was a member in the late 1990s. I also assisted with FIRST duties when Foundstone was a member in the early 2000s. I helped or sponsored membership when I worked at General Electric in the 2000s and Mandiant in the 2010s. I encourage all capable security teams to join FIRST.





Being a FIRST member means having a certain degree of incident response and data handling capability, and it signals to the world and to other FIRST teams that the member entity is serious about incident detection and response.





As of the writing of this post, there are 540 FIRST teams worldwide. Slightly more than 100 of them are based in the United States.





To put that in perspective, there are less than 4,000 publicly traded companies in the US. That means that even if every single US FIRST member represented a publicly traded company -- and that is not the case -- FIRST representation for US publicly traded companies is only 2.5%.





Beyond FIRST





Some of you might claim FIRST membership is no big deal. My current employer, Corelight, isn't a member, you might say.





Perhaps you could argue that for every US FIRST member, there are 9 others which have equivalent or better security teams. That would increase the cadre of entities with respectable detection and response capabilities from 100 to 1,000. That would still mean an estimate that says 75% of publicly traded US companies have sub-par or non-existent security programs.





Remember that we've only been talking about a population of 4,000 publicly traded US companies. The US Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council estimates that there were 5.6 million employer firms in the United States in 2016. Let's sadly reduce that to 4 million to account for the devastation of Covid.





(This reduction actually makes the situation actually look better for security, as terrible as it is either way. In other words, if I used a denominator of 5.6 million and not 4 million, security estimates would be 40% worse.)









Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council







Let's be really generous and assume that only 1 in 100 of those 4 million businesses have any sensitive data. (That's again very generous.)





That leaves us with 400,000 entities with data worth defending. (Again, all of these estimates make it look like we're doing better than we actually are. The reality is probably a lot worse.)





Remember that we only had 100 US teams in FIRST, and we assumed an incredible 10-to-1 ratio to add another 900 non-FIRST organizations to the list of entities with decent security.





Now let's be generous again and assume a 4-to-1 ratio, such that for every 1 team in the publicly traded world there are 3 in the private world that also have decent security.





This creates a total of 4,000 US organizations with decent security, out of 400,000 that need it. Those 4,000 are the security 1%.





If you think of the ""best of the best,"" there's probably only about 40 US security teams that qualify as global leaders and innovators. These are the teams that can stand toe-to-toe with most foes, and still struggle due to the nature of the security challenge. You and I could probably name them: Lockheed Martin, Google, General Electric, etc.





That group of 40 is the 1% of the 1%, being 40 of the 4,000 of the 400,000. These 40 are the US .01%.





If you think I'm being too conservative with only 40 teams, then feel free to increase it to 400. I'd be really curious to see someone compile a list of 400 world-beating security teams. That would still mean that US group of 400 is the .1%.





Sanity Check: A Few Statistics





To give you a sense of my numbers, and whether they are of the right order of magnitude at least, here are a few statistics:





1. The 2020 Accenture Security Third Annual State of Cyber Resilience Report featured responses from 4,644 ""executives,"" This is the same order of magnitude of my estimates here, diluted due to a global perspective. (In other words, there are actually less US executives responding to this survey due to the global respondent pool.)









2020 Accenture Security Third Annual State of Cyber Resilience Report, p 46







2. The 2021 PWC Global Digital Trust Insights Report featured responses from ""3,249 business and technology executives around the world."" This is again the same order of magnitude, again diluted due to global responses.





2021 PWC Global Digital Trust Insights Report, Web summary







3. A 2019 report by Bitglass found that 38% of the Fortune 500 do not have a CISO. That's 190 publicly traded companies! Hopefully it's less in 2020. Let's be crazy and assume the CISO count is 400 out of 500?





2019 Bitglass Report







4. The Verizon DBIR featured reporting from 81 entities, the highest number in the history of the report. I do not know how many are in the US, but it's obviously less than 100, so the order of magnitude is again preserved. In other words, of the 4,000 capable security organizations in the US, less than 2.5% of them contributed to the DBIR. That would be less than 100, or the number of US FIRST teams.









2020 Verizon DBIR Report







Remember that my focus here is the United States. This means the numbers from PWC, Accenture, and Verizon need to be reduced because they represent global audiences. However, the original FIRST count of roughly 100 American entities, and the statistic about the Fortune 500, which is just American companies, are already appropriately sized.





Security and the One Percent





What do these numbers mean for security?





Speaking first just for the US, it means that most of the conversations among security practitioners on Twitter, in mailing lists, during Webinars, within classes, and other gatherings of people take place within a very small grouping. These are the 1% that are part of the roughly 4,000 entities in the US that have a decent security capability.





If those are the 1%, it means that the 99% are not included in these discussions.





This means that free threat intelligence, or free classes, or free post-exploitation security tools, or other free capabilities mean nothing, or almost nothing to those 99% of organizations that do not have security capabilities, or whose capabilities are so low or stretched that they cannot take advantage of whatever the 1% offers.





An Analogy: Personal Finance





I almost became a certified financial planner. Had I not secured a job in the AFCERT, I planned to separate from the Air Force, earn my CFP designation, and advise people on how to manage their assets and prepare for retirement.





I've come to realize that discussions I witness in the ""security community"" are like the discussions I see in the finance community. It requires taking a big step back to appreciate this situation.





People at the 1% level in finance want to know how to manage their stock options, or how to save money for their child's college tuition through specialized savings vehicle, or, at the highest ends, how to move assets throughout ""Moneyland"" in pursuit of ever lower taxes.





These concerns are light-years away from the person who has a few dollars saved in an employer-provided 401(k) program, or who has little to no savings whatsoever.









The Consequences of the Security One Percent





So what's the big deal?





The consequence of the existence and mindshare dominance of the security 1% is that the strategies and tactics they employ may work for the 1% , but not the 99%.





I'm not talking about the ""rich"" preying on the ""poor."" That's neither my message nor my philosophical outlook.





Rather, I mean that methods that the security 1% use to defend themselves are irrelevant at best to the 99%, and damaging at worst to the 99%.





An example of irrelevance would be providing free indicators of compromise (IOCs) or other forms of threat intelligence. It's well-meaning but ultimately of no help to the 99%. If an entity in the 99% has a rudimentary security capability, or essentially zero security capability, threat intelligence is irrelevant.





An example of damage would be publication of post-exploitation security tools, or PESTs. The 1% may have the ability to use such tools to equip their red or penetration testing teams, determining if the countermeasures implemented by their blue team can resist or detect and respond to their simulated and later actual attacks. The 99%, however, have little to no ability to leverage PESTs. They end up simply being victims when actual intruders use PESTs to pillage the 99%'s assets.





Conclusion





Readers can argue with my numbers. These are estimates, yes, but I believe I've gotten the orders of magnitude right, at least in the US. It's probably worse overseas, especially in the developing world.





The point of this exercise is to propose the idea that the benefits of certain activities that may accrue to the 1% may be, and likely are, irrelevant and/or damaging to the 99%.





In brief:





I challenge the security 1% to first recognize their elite status, and second, to think how their beliefs and actions affect the 99% -- especially for the worse.

Just what are ""tactics""?





Introduction





MITRE ATT&CK is a great resource, but something about it has bothered me since I first heard about it several years ago. It's a minor point, but I wanted to document it in case it confuses anyone else.





The MITRE ATT&CK Design and Philosophy document from March 2020 says the following:





At a high-level, ATT&CK is a behavioral model that consists of the following core components:

• Tactics, denoting short-term, tactical adversary goals during an attack; • Techniques, describing the means by which adversaries achieve tactical goals; • Sub-techniques, describing more specific means by which adversaries achieve tactical goals at a lower level than techniques; and • Documented adversary usage of techniques, their procedures, and other metadata.

My concern is with MITRE's definition of ""tactics"" as ""short-term, tactical adversary goals during an attack,"" which is oddly recursive.

The key word in the tactics definition is goals. According to MITRE, ""tactics"" are ""goals.""

Examples of ATT&CK Tactics

ATT&CK lists the following as "" Enterprise Tactics "":





MITRE ATT&CK ""Tactics,"" https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise/



Looking at this list, the first 11 items could indeed be seen as goals. The last item, Impact, is not a goal. That item is an artifact of trying to shoehorn more information into the ATT&CK structure. That's not my primary concern though.





Military Theory and Definitions





As a service academy graduate who had to sit through many lectures on military theory, and who participated in small unit exercises, the idea of tactics as ""goals"" does not make any sense.





I'd like to share three resources that offer a different perspective on tactics. Although all three are military, my argument does not depend on that association.





employment and ordered arrangement of forces in relation to each other. See also procedures; techniques. (CJCSM 5120.01)"" (emphasis added) The DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms defines tactics as ""theSee also procedures; techniques. (CJCSM 5120.01)"" (emphasis added)





In his book On Tactics, B. A. Friedman defines tactics as ""the use of military forces to achieve victory over opposing enemy forces over the short term."" (emphasis added)





Dr. Martin van Creveld, scholar and author from the military strategy world, wrote the excellent Encyclopedia Britannica entry on tactics . His article includes the following:





""Tactics, in warfare, the art and science of fighting battles on land, on sea, and in the air. It is concerned with the approach to combat; the disposition of troops and other personalities; the use made of various arms, ships, or aircraft; and the execution of movements for attack or defense...

The word tactics originates in the Greek taxis, meaning order, arrangement, or disposition -- including the kind of disposition in which armed formations used to enter and fight battles. From this, the Greek historian Xenophon derived the term tactica, the art of drawing up soldiers in array. Likewise, the Tactica, an early 10th-century handbook said to have been written under the supervision of the Byzantine emperor Leo VI the Wise, dealt with formations as well as weapons and the ways of fighting with them.

The term tactics fell into disuse during the European Middle Ages. It reappeared only toward the end of the 17th century, when “Tacticks” was used by the English encyclopaedist John Harris to mean 'the Art of Disposing any Number of Men into a proposed form of Battle...'""

From these three examples, it is clear that tactics are about use and disposition of forces or capabilities during engagements. Goals are entirely different. Tactics are the methods by which leaders achieve goals.

How Did This Happen?

I was not a fly on the wall when the MITRE team designed ATT&CK. Perhaps the MITRE team fixated on the phrase""tactics, techniques, and procedures,"" or ""TTPs,"" again derived from military examples, when they were designing ATT&CK? TTPs became hot during the 2000s as incident responders drew with military experience drew on that language when developing concepts like indicators of compromise . That fixation might have led MITRE to use ""tactics"" for their top-level structure.

It would have made more sense for MITRE to have just said ""goal"" or ""objective,"" but ""GTP"" isn't recognized by the digital defender world.

It's Not Just the Military

Some readers might think ""ATT&CK isn't a military tool, so your military examples don't apply."" I use the military references to show that the word tactic does have military origins, like the word ""strategy,"" from the Greek Strategos or strategus, plural strategoi, (Greek: στρατηγός, pl. στρατηγοί; Doric Greek: στραταγός, stratagos; meaning ""army leader"").

That said, I would be surprised to see the word tactics used as ""goals"" anywhere else. For example, none of these examples from the non-military world involve tactics as goals:

This Harvard Business Review article defines tactics as ""the day-to-day and month-to-month decisions required to manage a business.""





This guide for ice hockey coaches mentions tactics like ""give and go’s, crossing attacks, cycling the puck, chipping the puck to space and overlapping.""





The guide for small business marketing lists tactics like advertising, grass-roots efforts, trade shows, website optimization, and email and social marketing.





In the civilian world, tactics are how leaders achieve goals or objectives.





Conclusion





In the big picture, it doesn't matter that much to ATT&CK content that MITRE uses the term ""tactics"" when it really means ""goals.""





However, I wrote this article because the ATT&CK design and philosophy emphasizes a common language, e.g., ATT&CK ""succinctly organizes adversary tactics and techniques along with providing a common language used across security disciplines.""





If we want to share a common language, it's important that we recognize that the ATT&CK use of the term ""tactics"" is an anomaly. Perhaps a future edition will change the terminology, but I doubt it given how entrenched it is at this point.





Update: This : This Tweet from Matt Brady made this point:





""Agreed - for example, supply chain compromise is a tactic used for initial access, whereas software supply chain compromise (ShadowHammer) is a specific technique."""

Background





First, some background. Who is Greg Rattray?





First, you could call him Colonel or Doctor. I will use Col as that was the last title I used with him, although these days when we chat I call him Greg.





Col Rattray served 21 years in the Air Force and also earned his PhD in international security from Tufts University. His thesis formed the content for his 2001 book Strategic Warfare in Cyberspace , which I reviewed in 2002 and rated 4 stars . (Ouch -- I was a bit stingy with the stars back then. I was more of an operator and less of a theorist or historian in those days. Such was my bias I suppose.)





Col Rattray is also a 1984 graduate of the Air Force Academy. He studied history and political science there and returned as an assistant professor in the early 1990s. He was one of my instructors when I was a cadet there. (I graduated in 1994 with degrees in history and political science.) Col Rattray then earned a master of public policy degree at Harvard Kennedy School. (I did the same, in 1996.)





Do you see a pattern here? He is clearly a role model. Of course, I did not stay in the Air Force as long, earn the same rank, or survive my PhD program!





After the Academy, Col Rattray served as commander of the 23rd Information Operations Squadrons on Security Hill in San Antonio, Texas. I was working in the AFCERT at the time.





One of the last duties I had in uniform was to travel to Nellis AFB outside Las Vegas and participate in a doctrine writing project for information warfare. At the time I was not a fan of the idea, but Col Rattray convinced me someone needed to write down how we did computer network defense in the AFCERT.





He didn't order me to participate, which I always appreciated. Years later I told him it was a good idea to organize that project and that I was probably just grumpy because of the way the Air Force personnel system had treated me at the end of my military career.





Why The Tweet Matters





For years I've had to dance around the issue of who invented the term ""APT."" In most narratives I say that an Air Force colonel invented the term in 2006. I based this on discussions I had with colleagues in the defense industrial base who were working with said colonel and his team from the Air Force. I did not know back then that it was Col Rattray and his team from the Air Force Information Warfare Center.





Years later I learned of Rattray's role, but not directly from him. Only this year did Col Rattray confirm to me that he had invented the term, and that 2007 was the correct year. I encouraged him to say something, because as an historian I appreciate the value of facts and narrative. As I Tweeted after seeing Greg's Tweet:





""Security, like any other field, has HISTORY, which means there are beginnings, and stories, and discoveries, and innovators, and leaders, and first steps, and pioneers. I'm so pleased to see people like @GregRattray_ feel comfortable enough after all these years to say something.""

I don't think many people in the security field think about history. Security tends to be obsessed with the ""new"" and the ""shiny."" Not enough people wonder how we got to this point, or what decisions led to the current situation. The security scene in 2020 is very different from the scene in 1960, or 1970, or 1980, or 1990, or 2000, or even 2010. This is not the time to describe how or why that is the case. I'm just glad a very important piece of the puzzle is now public.

I was reminded of the importance of this program by Andy Greenberg's new story The FBI Botched Its DNC Hack Warning in 2016—but Says It Won’t Next Time.
However, I do not see why the FBI is supposed to carry the blame for how this intrusion unfolded.","The FBI intrusion notification program is one of the most important developments in cyber security during the last 15 years.

This program achieved mainstream recognition on 24 March 2014 when Ellen Nakashima reported on it for the Washington Post in her story U.S. notified 3,000 companies in 2013 about cyberattacks.

The story noted the following:

""Federal agents notified more than 3,000 U.S. companies last year that their computer systems had been hacked, White House officials have told industry executives, marking the first time the government has revealed how often it tipped off the private sector to cyberintrusions...

About 2,000 of the notifications were made in person or by phone by the FBI, which has 1,000 people dedicated to cybersecurity investigations among 56 field offices and its headquarters.

Officials with the Secret Service, an agency of the Department of Homeland Security that investigates financially motivated cybercrimes, said that they notified companies in 590 criminal cases opened last year, officials said. Some cases involved more than one company.""

The reason this program is so important is that it shattered the delusion that some executives used to reassure themselves. When the FBI visits your headquarters to tell you that you are compromised, you can't pretend that intrusions are ""someone else's problem.""

It may be difficult for some readers to appreciate how prevalent this mindset was, from the beginnings of IT to about the year 2010.

I do not know exactly when the FBI began notifying victims, but I believe the mid-2000's is a safe date. I can personally attest to the program around that time.

I was reminded of the importance of this program by Andy Greenberg's new story The FBI Botched Its DNC Hack Warning in 2016—but Says It Won’t Next Time.

I strongly disagree with this ""botched"" characterization. Andy writes:

""[S]omehow this breach [of the Democratic National Committee] had come as a terrible surprise—despite an FBI agent's warning to [IT staffer Yared] Tamene of potential Russian hacking over a series of phone calls that had begun fully nine months earlier.

The FBI agent's warnings had 'never used alarming language,' Tamene would tell the Senate committee, and never reached higher than the DNC's IT director, who dismissed them after a cursory search of the network for signs of foul play.""

As with all intrusions, criminal responsibility lies with the intruder. However, I do not see why the FBI is supposed to carry the blame for how this intrusion unfolded.

According to investigatory documents and this Crowdstrike blog post on their involvement, at least seven months passed from the time the FBI notified the DNC (sometime in September 2015) and when they contacted Crowdstrike (30 April 2016). That is ridiculous.

If I received a call from the FBI even hinting at a Russian presence in my network, I would be on the phone with a professional incident response firm right after I briefed the CEO about the call.

I'm glad the FBI continues to improve its victim notification procedures, but it doesn't make much of a difference if the individuals running IT and the organization are negligent, either through incompetence or inaction.

The Best of TaoSecurity Blog, Volume 2: Network Security Monitoring, Technical Notes, Research, and China and the Advanced Persistent Threat

It's in the Kindle Store, and if you're Unlimited it's free. Print edition to follow.

The book lists as having 413 pages (for the Kindle edition at least) at it's almost 95,000 words. I started working on it in June after finishing Volume 1.

Here is the book description:

Since 2003, cybersecurity author Richard Bejtlich has been writing posts on TaoSecurity Blog, a site with 15 million views since 2011. Now, after re-reading over 3,000 posts and approximately one million words, he has selected and republished the very best entries from 17 years of writing.

In the second volume of the TaoSecurity Blog series, Mr. Bejtlich addresses how to detect and respond to intrusions using third party threat intelligence sources, network data, application and infrastructure data, and endpoint data. He assesses government and private security initiatives and applies counterintelligence and counteradversary mindsets to defend digital assets. He documents the events of the last 20 years of Chinese hacking from the perspective of a defender on the front lines, in the pre- and post-APT era.

This volume contains some of Mr. Bejtlich’s favorite posts, such as histories of threat hunting, so-called black and white hat budgeting, attribution capabilities and limits, and rating information security incidents. He has written new commentaries to accompany each post, some of which would qualify as blog entries in their own right. Read how the security industry, defensive methodologies, and strategies to improve national security have evolved in this new book, written by one of the authors who has seen it all and survived to blog about it.

I have a third volume planned. I will publish it by the end of the year.

If yes, try this one weird trick!





I store my Zeek logs in JSON format. Sometimes I like to view the output using jq.





If I need to search directories of logs for a string, like a UID, I might* use something like zgrep with the following syntax:

Maybe this will help you too.





*I use the find command in other circumstances.





Update: Twitter user @captainGeech42 Twitter user @captainGeech42 noted that I could use grep -h and omit the sed pipe, e.g.:





$ zgrep -h ""CLkXf2CMo11hD8FQ5"" 2020-08-16/* | jq .





Thanks for the tip!





Are you a network security monitoring dinosaur like me? Do you prefer to inspect your Zeek logs using the command line instead of a Web-based SIEM?"

Currently you can see the table of contents via the ""Look Inside"" function, and there is a sample that lets you download and read some of the book. Enjoy!"

One of my laws is the following:Analysts are good because they have good data.

These are certainly unusual times.I was thinking about words to describe different skill levels in digital security.","The novice is a (person) who has no trade ability whatever, or at least none that could not be paralleled by practically any intelligent (person). An apprentice has acquired some of the elements of the trade but is not sufficiently skilled to be trusted with any important task. The journey(person) is qualified to perform almost any work done by members of the trade. An expert can perform quickly and with superior skill any work done by (people) in the trade.

I believe these four categories can apply to some degree to the needs of the digital security profession.





At GE-CIRT we had three levels -- event analyst, incident analyst, and incident handler. We did not hire novices, so those three roles map in some ways to apprentice, journeyperson, and expert.





One difference with the classical description applies to how we worked with apprentices. We trusted apprentices, or event analysts, with specific tasks. We thought of this work as important, just as every role on a team is important. It may not have been leading an incident response, but without the work of the event and incident analysts, we may not have discovered many incidents!





Crucially, we encouraged event analysts, and incident analysts for that matter, to always be looking to exceed the parameters of their assigned duties.





However, we stipulated that if a person was working beyond their assigned duties, they had to have their work product reviewed by the next level of analysis. This enabled mentoring among the various groups. It also helped identify people who were candidates for promotion. If a person consistently worked beyond their assigned duties, and eventually reached a near-perfect or perfect ability to do that work, that proved he or she was ready to assume the next level.





This ability to access work beyond assigned duties is one reason I have problems with limiting data by role. I think everyone who works in a CIRT should have access to all of the data, assuming there are no classification, privacy, or active investigation constraints.





One of my laws is the following:





Analysts are good because they have good data. An expert with bad data is helpless. An apprentice with good data has a chance to do good work.





I've said it more eloquently elsewhere but this is the main point.





For more information on the apprenticeship model, this article might be useful.

I only use a thread, and no more than 2, and hardly ever 3 (good Lord), when I know I've got nothing more to say. ""1/10,"" ""1/n,"" etc. are not for me.""<br /><br />Then I realized I had something more to say, namely, other reasons blog posts are better than Tweets. For the briefest moment I considered adding a second Tweet, making, horror of horrors, a THREAD, and then I realized I would be breaking my own guidance.<br /><br />Here are three reasons to consider blogging over Tweeting.<br /><br />1. If you find yourself trying to pack your thoughts into a 280 character limit, then you should write a blog post. You might have a good idea, and instead of expressing it properly, you're falling into the trap of <b>letting the medium define the message</b>, aka the PowerPoint trap. I learned this from Edward Tufte: <b>let the message define the medium</b>, not the other way around.<br /><br />2. Twitter threads lose the elegance and readability of the English language as our ancestors created it, for our benefit. They gave us structures, like sentences, lists, indentation, paragraphs, chapters, and so on. What does Twitter provide? 280 character chunks. Sure, you can apply feeble ""1/n"" annotations, but you've lost all that structure and readability, and for what?<br /><br />3. In the event you're writing a Tweet thread that's really worth reading, writing it via Twitter virtually guarantees that it's lost to history. Twitter is an abomination for citation, search, and future reference. In the hierarchy of delivering content for current researchers and future generations, the hierarchy is the following, from lowest to highest:<br /><br /><ul><li>""Transient,"" ""bite-sized"" social media, e.g., Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, etc. posts</li><li>Blog posts</li><li>Whitepapers</li><li>Academic papers in ""electronic"" journals</li><li>Electronic (e.g., Kindle) only formatted books</li><li>Print books (that may be stand-alone works, or which may contain journal articles)</li></ul><br />Print book are the apex communication medium because we have such references going back hundreds of years. Hundreds of years from now, I doubt the first five formats above will be easily accessible, or accessible at all. However, in a library or personal collection somewhere, printed books will endure.<br /><br />The bottom line is that if you think what you're writing is important enough to start a ""1/n"" Tweet thread, you've already demonstrated that Twitter is the wrong medium.<br /><br />The natural follow-on might be: what is Twitter good for? Here are my suggestions:<br /><br /><ul><li>Announcing a link to another, in-depth news resource, like a news article, blog post, whitepaper, etc.</li><li>Offering a comment on an in-depth news resource, or replying to another person's announcement.</li><li>Asking a poll question.</li><li>Asking for help on a topic.</li><li>Engaging in a short exchange with another user. Long exchanges on hot topics typically devolve into a confusing mess of messages and replies, that delivery of which Twitter has never really managed to figure out.</li></ul><br />I understand the seduction of Twitter. I use it every day. However, when it really matters, blogging is preferable, followed by the other media I listed in point 3 above.<br /><br /><b>Update 0930 ET 27 Mar 2020:</b> I forgot to mention that in extenuating circumstances, like live-Tweeting an emergency, Twitter threads on significant matters are fine because the urgency of the situation and the convenience or plain logistical limitations of the situation make Twitter indispensable. I'm less thrilled by live-Tweeting in conferences, although I'm guilty of it in the past.

Announcing a link to another, in-depth news resource, like a news article, blog post, whitepaper, etc.

Offering a comment on an in-depth news resource, or replying to another person's announcement.

Asking a poll question.

Asking for help on a topic.

Engaging in a short exchange with another user. Long exchanges on hot topics typically devolve into a confusing mess of messages and replies, that delivery of which Twitter has never really managed to figure out.

I saw my like-minded, friend-that-I've-never-met Andrew Thompson Tweet a poll , posted above.I was about to reply with the following Tweet:""If I'm struggling to figure out how to capture a thought in just 1 Tweet, that's a sign that a blog post might be appropriate. I only use a thread, and no more than 2, and hardly ever 3 (good Lord), when I know I've got nothing more to say. ""1/10,"" ""1/n,"" etc. are not for me.""Then I realized I had something more to say, namely, other reasons blog posts are better than Tweets. For the briefest moment I considered adding a second Tweet, making, horror of horrors, a THREAD, and then I realized I would be breaking my own guidance.Here are three reasons to consider blogging over Tweeting.1. If you find yourself trying to pack your thoughts into a 280 character limit, then you should write a blog post. You might have a good idea, and instead of expressing it properly, you're falling into the trap of, aka the PowerPoint trap. I learned this from Edward Tufte:, not the other way around.2. Twitter threads lose the elegance and readability of the English language as our ancestors created it, for our benefit. They gave us structures, like sentences, lists, indentation, paragraphs, chapters, and so on. What does Twitter provide? 280 character chunks. Sure, you can apply feeble ""1/n"" annotations, but you've lost all that structure and readability, and for what?3. In the event you're writing a Tweet thread that's really worth reading, writing it via Twitter virtually guarantees that it's lost to history. Twitter is an abomination for citation, search, and future reference. In the hierarchy of delivering content for current researchers and future generations, the hierarchy is the following, from lowest to highest:Print book are the apex communication medium because we have such references going back hundreds of years. Hundreds of years from now, I doubt the first five formats above will be easily accessible, or accessible at all. However, in a library or personal collection somewhere, printed books will endure.The bottom line is that if you think what you're writing is important enough to start a ""1/n"" Tweet thread, you've already demonstrated that Twitter is the wrong medium.The natural follow-on might be: what is Twitter good for? Here are my suggestions:I understand the seduction of Twitter. I use it every day. However, when it really matters, blogging is preferable, followed by the other media I listed in point 3 above.I forgot to mention that in extenuating circumstances, like live-Tweeting an emergency, Twitter threads on significant matters are fine because the urgency of the situation and the convenience or plain logistical limitations of the situation make Twitter indispensable. I'm less thrilled by live-Tweeting in conferences, although I'm guilty of it in the past. I'd prefer a thoughtful wrap-up post following the event, which I did a lot before Twitter became popular."

Threat elimination.
This is a hybrid strategy which welcomes contributions from vulnerability elimination, primarily, but is open to assistance from loss transferal, threat elimination, and asset value elimination.
I believe the vulnerability elimination strategy is important but ultimately, on its own, ineffective and historically shown to be impossible.
I believe the threat elimination strategy is generally beyond the scope of private organizations.","Denial and/or ignorance. This strategy assumes the risk due to loss is low, because those managing the risk assume that one or more of the elements of the risk equation are zero or almost zero, or they are apathetic to the cost. Loss acceptance. This strategy may assume the risk due to loss is low, or more likely those managing the risk assume that the cost of risk realization is low. In other words, incidents will occur, but the cost of the incident is acceptable to the organization. Loss transferal. This strategy may also assume the risk due to loss is low, but in contrast with risk acceptance, the organization believes it can buy an insurance policy which will cover the cost of an incident, and the cost of the policy is cheaper than alternative strategies. Vulnerability elimination. This strategy focuses on driving the vulnerability element of the risk equation to zero or almost zero, through secure coding, proper configuration, patching, and similar methods. Threat elimination. This strategy focuses on driving the threat element of the risk equation to zero or almost zero, through deterrence, dissuasion, co-option, bribery, conversion, incarceration, incapacitation, or other methods that change the intent and/or capabilities of threat actors. Asset value elimination. This strategy focuses on driving the threat element of the risk equation to zero or almost zero, through minimizing data or resources that might be valued by adversaries. Interdiction. This is a hybrid strategy which welcomes contributions from vulnerability elimination, primarily, but is open to assistance from loss transferal, threat elimination, and asset value elimination. Interdiction assumes that prevention eventually fails, but that security teams can detect and respond to incidents post-compromise and pre-breach. In other words, some classes of intruders will indeed compromise an organization, but it is possible to detect and respond to the attack before the adversary completes his mission.

As you might expect, I am most closely associated with the interdiction strategy.





I believe the denial and/or ignorance and loss acceptance strategies are irresponsible.





I believe the loss transferal strategy continues to gain momentum with the growth of cybersecurity breach insurance policies.





I believe the vulnerability elimination strategy is important but ultimately, on its own, ineffective and historically shown to be impossible. When used in concert with other strategies, it is absolutely helpful.





I believe the threat elimination strategy is generally beyond the scope of private organizations. As the state retains the monopoly on the use of force, usually only law enforcement, military, and sometimes intelligence agencies can truly eliminate or mitigate threats. (Threats are not vulnerabilities.)





I believe asset value elimination is powerful but has not gained the ground I would like to see. This is my "" If you can’t protect it, don’t collect it "" message. The limitation here is obviously one's raw computing elements. If one were to magically strip down every computing asset into basic operating systems on hardware or cloud infrastructure, the fact that those assets exist and are networked means that any adversary can abuse them for mining cryptocurrencies, or as infrastructure for intrusions, or for any other uses of raw computing power.

Nineteen years ago this week I registered the domain taosecurity.com:





Creation Date: 2000-07-04T02:20:16Z





This was 2 1/2 years before I started blogging, so I don't have much information from that era. I did create the first taosecurity.com Web site shortly thereafter.





I first started hosting it on space provided by my then-ISP, Road Runner of San Antonio, TX. According to archive.org, it looked like this in February 2002









That is some fine-looking vintage hand-crafted HTML. Because I lived in Texas I apparently reached for the desert theme with the light tan background. Unfortunately I didn't have the ""under construction"" gif working for me.





As I got deeper into the security scene, I decided to simplify and adopt a dark look. By this time I had left Texas and was in the DC area, working for Foundstone. According to archive.org, the site look like this in April 2003









Notice I've replaced the oh-so-cool picture of me doing American Kenpo in the upper-left-hand corner with the classic Bruce Lee photo from the cover of The Tao of Jeet Kune Do. This version marks the first appearance of my classic TaoSecurity logo.





A little more than two years later, I decided to pursue TaoSecurity as an independent consultant. To launch my services, I painstakingly created more hand-written HTML and graphics to deliver this beauty. According to archive.org, the site looked like this in May 2005









I mean, can you even believe how gorgeous that site is? Look at the subdued gray TaoSecurity logo, the red-highlighted menu boxes, etc. I should have kept that site forever.

After four versions in four years, my primary Web site stayed that way... for thirteen years. Oh, I modified the content, SSH'ing into the server hosted by my friend Phil Hagen, manually editing the HTML using vi (and careful not to touch the CSS).

Scolling down provides information on my books, which I figured is what most people who visit the site care about.









For reference, I moved the content (which I haven't been updated) about news press , and research to individual TaoSecurity Blog posts.





It's possible you will not see the site, if your DNS servers have the old IP addresses cached. That should all expire no later than tomorrow afternoon, I imagine.





Let's see if the new site lasts another thirteen years?"

That’s why we're thrilled to collaborate with the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to support and develop a new <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/08/25/fact-sheet-biden-administration-and-private-sector-leaders-announce-ambitious-initiatives-to-bolster-the-nations-cybersecurity/"">framework</a> that will help to improve the security and integrity of the technology supply chain.<br /><br />This builds on our previous work in June of this year, where we submitted four statements in response to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and NIST’s <a href=""https://www.nist.gov/itl/executive-order-improving-nations-cybersecurity/workshop-and-call-position-papers"">call for position papers</a> to help guide adoption of new software supply chain security standards and guidelines that fulfill components of the <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/"">Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity</a>.<br /><br />The papers lay out concrete ways to increase the nation’s cybersecurity, based on Google’s experience building secure by design systems for our users and enterprise customers. Each of the suggestions are enactable solutions for software supply chain security, and were drawn from Google’s research and innovations in engineering away entire classes of vulnerabilities.<br /><br />NIST and NTIA also released their guidelines in July for several of the Executive Order’s target areas (<a href=""https://www.ntia.gov/files/ntia/publications/sbom_minimum_elements_report.pdf"">SBOM Minimum Elements</a>, <a href=""https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2021/07/09/Critical%20Software%20Use%20Security%20Measures%20Guidance.pdf"">Critical Software Guidelines</a>,<a href=""https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2021/07/13/Developer%20Verification%20of%20Software.pdf""> Developer Verification of Software</a>), incorporating specific recommendations from Google. Below are summaries of each of Google’s position papers, and background on our contributions and impact in each area.<br /><br /><div><a href=""https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/noindex/2021/06/08/Google%20NIST%20statement%20on%20%282%29%20development.pdf""><b>High-Confidence, Scalable Secure Development</b></a>  <br /><br />Instead of being reactive to vulnerabilities, we should eliminate them proactively with secure languages, platforms, and frameworks that stop entire classes of bugs. <br /><br />Preventing problems before they leave the developer’s keyboard is safer and more cost effective than trying to fix vulnerabilities and their fallout. (Consider the enormous impact of the SolarWinds attack, which is predicted to take <a href=""https://www.rpc.senate.gov/policy-papers/the-solarwinds-cyberattack"">$100 billion to remediate</a>.) Google promotes  designs that are secure by default and impervious to simple errors that can lead to security vulnerabilities.<br /><br />We want to see secure systems used as widely as possible, so we have invested in initiatives such as getting <a href=""https://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/press-release/google-funds-linux-kernel-developers-to-focus-exclusively-on-security/"">Rust into the Linux Kernel</a>, published <a href=""https://research.google/pubs/pub42934/"">research papers</a>, and shared <a href=""https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3447806&amp;doi=10.1145%2F3442632.3447806"">guidance on secure frameworks</a>.<br /><br /><div><a href=""https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/noindex/2021/06/08/Google%20NIST%20statement%20on%20%283%29%20security%20measures.pdf""><b>Security Measures for Critical Software</b></a> <br /><br />Critical software does not exist in a vacuum; we must also harden the broader systems and run environments. Our paper outlines a list of actionable steps for critical software's configuration, the privileges with which it runs, and the network(s) to which it is connected.<br /><br />Our suggestions are based on practices that have withstood the tests of time and scale, such as in our Google Cloud Products, built on <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/delivering-the-industrys-most-trusted-cloud"">one of the industry’s most trusted clouds</a>.<br /><br />Google contributes to open-source tools that help maintainers adopt these practices, such as <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/how-gvisor-protects-google-cloud-services-from-cve-2020-14386"">gVisor</a> for sandboxing, and <a href=""https://github.com/google/glome"">GLOME </a>for authentication and authorization. Additionally, to share the knowledge we have gained securing systems that serve billions of users, we released our book <a href=""https://sre.google/books/building-secure-reliable-systems/"">Building Secure and Reliable Systems</a>, a resource for any organization that wants to design systems that are fundamentally secure, reliable, and scalable.<div>&nbsp; <br /><a href=""https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/noindex/2021/06/08/Google%20NIST%20statement%20on%20%284%29%20testing.pdf""><b>Software Source Code Testing</b></a><br /><br /><a href=""https://opensource.googleblog.com/2019/02/open-sourcing-clusterfuzz.html"">Continuous fuzzing</a> is indispensable for identifying bugs and catching vulnerabilities before attackers do. We also suggest securing dependencies using automated tools such as <a href=""https://github.com/ossf/scorecard"">Scorecards</a>, <a href=""https://github.blog/2020-06-01-keep-all-your-packages-up-to-date-with-dependabot/"">Dependabot</a>, and <a href=""https://osv.dev/"">OSV</a>.<br /><br />Google has made huge contributions to the field of fuzzing, and has found tens of thousands of bugs with tools like <a href=""https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html"">libFuzzer</a> and <a href=""https://opensource.googleblog.com/2019/02/open-sourcing-clusterfuzz.html"">ClusterFuzz</a>.<br /><br />We have made continuous fuzzing available to all developers through <a href=""https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz/getting-started/continuous-integration/"">OSS-Fuzz</a>, and are <a href=""https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz/getting-started/integration-rewards/"">funding integration costs</a> and <a href=""https://security.googleblog.com/2020/10/fuzzing-internships-for-open-source.html"">fuzzing internships</a>. We are leading a shift in industry support: on top of <a href=""https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/reward-program/index.html"">bug bounties</a>, which are rewards programs for finding bugs, we have also added <a href=""https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/patch-rewards/"">patch rewards</a>, money that can help fund maintainers remediate uncovered bugs.<div><br /><a href=""https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/noindex/2021/06/08/Google%20NIST%20statement%20on%20%285%29%20integrity.pdf""><b>Software Supply Chain Integrity</b></a> <br /><br />Google strongly encourages adoption of <a href=""http://slsa.dev/"">SLSA</a>, an end-to-end framework for ensuring the integrity of software artifacts throughout the software supply chain. Four “SLSA Levels” provide incrementally adoptable guidelines that each raise the bar on security standards for open-source software.<br /><br />SLSA is based on Google’s <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/security/binary-authorization-for-borg"">internal framework</a> Binary Authorization for Borg (BAB) that ensures that all software packages used by the company meet high integrity standards. Given BAB’s success, we have adapted the framework to work for systems beyond Google and released it as SLSA to help protect other organizations and platforms.<br /><br />We have shared many of Google’s practices for security and reliability in our <a href=""https://sre.google/books/"">Site Reliability Engineering </a>book. Following our recent <a href=""https://security.googleblog.com/2021/06/introducing-slsa-end-to-end-framework.html"">introduction of SLSA</a> to the wider public, we are looking forward to making improvements in response to community feedback.<div><br /><b><a href=""https://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/google_-_2021.06.17.pdf"">Minimum Requirements for SBOMs</a></b><br /><br />Google submitted an additional paper in response to the NTIA’s <a href=""https://www.ntia.gov/federal-register-notice/2021/notice-rfc-software-bill-materials-elements-considerations"">request for comments</a> on creating SBOMs, which will give users information about a software package’s contents. Modern development requires different approaches than classic packaged software, which means SBOMs must also deal with intermediate artifacts like containers and library dependencies.<br /><br />SBOMs need a reasonable signal-to-noise ratio: if they contain too much information, they won’t be useful, so we urge the NTIA to establish both minimum and maximum requirements on granularity and depth for specific use-cases. We also recommend considerations for the creation of trustworthy SBOMs, such as using verifiable data generation methods to capture metadata, and preparing for the automation and tooling technologies that will be key for widespread SBOM adoption.<br /><br /><div><b>Improving Everyone’s Security</b><br /><br />We are committed to <a href=""https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/how-google-supports-todays-critical-cybersecurity-efforts/"">helping advance collective cybersecurity</a>. We also realize that too many guidelines and lists of best practices can become overwhelming, but any incremental changes in the right direction make a real difference. We encourage companies and maintainers to start evaluating today where they stand on the most important security postures, and to make improvements with the guidance of these papers in the areas of greatest risk. No single entity can fix the problems we all face in this area, but by being open about our practices and sharing our research and tools, we can all help raise the standards for our collective security. </div></div></div></div></div></div><div class=""feedflare"">

However, in the face of failure, the car may end up on fire, flying off a cliff.<br /><br /><div>As we approach its 30th Anniversary, Linux still remains the largest collaborative development project in the history of computing. The huge community surrounding Linux allows it to do amazing things and run smoothly. What's still missing, though, is sufficient focus to make sure that Linux <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-safe"">fails well</a> too. There's a strong link between code robustness and security: making it harder for any bugs to manifest makes it harder for security flaws to manifest. But that's not the end of the story. When flaws do manifest, it's important to handle them effectively.</div><br />Rather than only taking a one-bug-at-a-time perspective, preemptive actions can stop bugs from having bad effects. With Linux written in <a href=""https://outflux.net/slides/2019/lca/danger.pdf"">C</a>, it will continue to have a long tail of associated <a href=""https://security.googleblog.com/2021/01/data-driven-security-hardening-in.html"">problems</a>. Linux must be designed to take proactive steps to defend itself from its own risks. Cars have seat belts not because we want to crash, but because it is guaranteed to happen sometimes.<br /><br />Even though everyone wants a safe kernel running on their computer, phone, car, or <a href=""https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/personalizing-your-profile#list-of-qualifying-repositories-for-mars-2020-helicopter-contributor-badge"">interplanetary helicopter</a>, not everyone is in a position to do something about it. Upstream kernel developers can fix bugs, but have no control over what a downstream vendor chooses to incorporate into their products. End users get to choose their products, but don't usually have control over what bugs are fixed nor what kernel is used (a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics_right_to_repair"">problem</a> in itself). Ultimately, vendors are responsible for keeping their product's kernels safe.<br /><br /><h3 style=""text-align: left;"">What to fix?</h3><div><br />The statistics of tracking and fixing distinct bugs are sobering. The <a href=""http://kroah.com/log/blog/2018/02/05/linux-kernel-release-model/"">stable kernel releases</a> (""bug fixes only"") each contain close to 100 new fixes per&nbsp;week.

But what constitutes ""important"" or even relevant? Just determining<i>&nbsp;</i>whether&nbsp;to implement a fix takes developer time.<br /><br />The prevailing wisdom has been to choose vulnerabilities to fix based on the Mitre <a href=""https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=%22linux+kernel%22"">CVE</a> list,  presuming all important flaws (and therefore fixes) would have an associated CVE. However, given the volume of flaws and their applicability to a particular system, not all security flaws have CVEs assigned, nor are they assigned in a timely manner. Evidence shows that for Linux CVEs, more than 40% had been fixed before the CVE was even assigned, with the average delay being <a href=""https://github.com/gregkh/presentation-cve-is-dead"">over three months after the fix</a>. Some fixes <a href=""https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2019/11/bad-binder-android-in-wild-exploit.html"">went years</a> without having their security impact recognized. On top of this, product-relevant bugs may not even <a href=""https://cve.mitre.org/cve/cna/rules.html#section_7_assignment_rules"">classify</a> for a CVE. Finally, upstream developers aren't actually interested in <a href=""https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/security-bugs.html#cve-assignment"">CVE assignment</a>; they spend their limited time actually fixing bugs.<br /><br />A vendor relying on cherry-picking is all but guaranteed to miss important vulnerabilities that others are actively fixing, which is almost worse than doing nothing since it creates the illusion that security updates are being appropriately handled.<br /></div><div><h3 style=""text-align: left;"">Fix everything!</h3>So what is a vendor to do? The answer is simple, if painful: continuously update to the <a href=""https://www.kernel.org/"">latest kernel release</a>, either major or stable. Tracking major releases means gaining <a href=""https://outflux.net/blog/?s=%22security+things%22"">security improvements</a> along with bug fixes, while stable releases are bug fixes only. For example, although modern Android phones ship with kernels that are based on major releases from almost <a href=""https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/kernel/android-common#compatibility-matrix"">two to four years earlier</a>, Android vendors do now, thankfully, <a href=""https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/kernel/releases"">track stable kernel releases</a>. So even though the features being added to newer major kernels will be missing, all the latest stable kernel fixes are present.<br /><br />Performing continuous kernel updates (major or stable) understandably faces enormous resistance within an organization due to fear of regressions—will the update break the product? The answer is usually that a vendor doesn't know, or that the update frequency is shorter than their time needed for testing. But the problem with updating is not that the kernel might cause regressions; it's that vendors don't have sufficient test coverage and automation to know the answer. Testing must take priority over individual fixes.</div><div><h3 style=""text-align: left;"">Make it happen</h3>One question remains: how to possibly support all the work continuous updates require? As it turns out, it’s a simple resource allocation problem, and is more easily accomplished than might be imagined: downstream redundancy can be moved into greater upstream collaboration.<br /><br /></div><div><h3 style=""text-align: left;"">More engineers for fixing bugs earlier</h3>With vendors using old kernels and backporting existing fixes, their engineering resources are doing redundant work. For example, instead of 10 companies each assigning one engineer to backport the same fix independently, those developer hours could be shifted to upstream work where 10 separate bugs could be fixed for everyone in the Linux ecosystem. This would help address the growing backlog of bugs. Looking at just one source of potential kernel security flaws, the <a href=""https://syzkaller.appspot.com/upstream"">syzkaller dashboard</a> shows the number of open bugs is currently approaching 900 and growing by about <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20200812135009/https://syzkaller.appspot.com/upstream"">100 a year</a>, even with about <a href=""https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?qt=grep&amp;q=Reported-by%3A+syzbot%2B"">400 a year</a> being fixed.</div><div><br /></div><div><h3 style=""text-align: left;"">More engineers for code review</h3>Beyond just squashing bugs after the fact, more focus on upstream code review will help stem the tide of their introduction in the first place, with benefits extending beyond just the immediate bugs caught. Capable code <a href=""https://lwn.net/Articles/718411/"">review bandwidth</a> is a limited resource. Without enough <a href=""https://kernel-recipes.org/en/2016/talks/maintainers-dont-scale/"">people dedicated</a> to upstream code review and subsystem maintenance tasks, the entire kernel development process bottlenecks.<br /><br />Long-term Linux robustness depends on developers, but especially on effective kernel <a href=""https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/role-of-a-linux-kernel-maintainer/"">maintainers</a>. Although there is effort in the industry to <a href=""https://training.linuxfoundation.org/linux-kernel-development/"">train</a> new developers, this has been traditionally justified only by the ""feature driven"" jobs they can get. But focusing only on product timelines ultimately leads Linux into the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons"">Tragedy of the Commons</a>. Expanding the number of maintainers can <a href=""https://techdebtpolicy.com/tragedy-of-the-commons/"">avoid it</a>. Luckily the ""pipeline"" for new maintainers is straightforward.<br /><br />Maintainers are built not only from their depth of knowledge of a subsystem's technology, but also from their experience with mentorship of other developers and code review. Training new reviewers must become the norm, motivated by making upstream review part of the job. Today's reviewers become tomorrow's maintainers. If each major kernel subsystem gained four more dedicated maintainers, we could <a href=""https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10106647"">double productivity</a>.</div><div><br /></div><h3 style=""text-align: left;"">More engineers for testing and infrastructure</h3><div>Along with more reviewers, improving Linux's <a href=""https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/development-process.html"">development workflow</a> is critical to expanding everyone's ability to contribute. Linux's ""email only"" workflow is <a href=""https://lwn.net/Articles/803619/"">showing its age</a>, but the upstream development of more automated <a href=""https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/netdevbpf/list/"">patch tracking</a>, <a href=""https://linux.kernelci.org/job/"">continuous integration</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/google/syzkaller/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22syzbot+user+request%22"">fuzzing</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/google/syzkaller/issues/533"">coverage</a>, and <a href=""https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/dev-tools/"">testing</a> will make the development process significantly more efficient.<br /><br />Additionally, instead of testing kernels after they're released, it's more effective to test during development. When tests are performed against unreleased kernel versions (e.g. <a href=""https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/next/linux-next.git"">linux-next</a>) and <a href=""https://groups.io/g/kernelci/message/1142"">reported upstream</a>, developers get immediate feedback about bugs. Fixes can be developed before a flaw is ever actually released; it's always easier to <a href=""https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/lessons/ten-reasons-why-you-fix-bugs-as-soon-as-you-find-them"">fix a bug earlier than later</a>.<br /><br />This ""<a href=""https://www.ibrahimatlinux.com/uploads/6/3/9/7/6397792/03.pdf"">upstream first</a>"" approach to product kernel development and testing is extremely efficient. Google has been successfully doing this with <a href=""https://lwn.net/Articles/798147/"">Chrome OS</a> and <a href=""https://lwn.net/Articles/771974/"">Android</a> for a while now, and is hardly alone in the industry. It means feature development happens against the latest kernel, and devices are similarly tested as close as possible to the latest upstream kernels, all avoiding duplicated ""in-house"" effort.<br /><br /></div><div><h3 style=""text-align: left;"">More engineers for security and toolchain development</h3>Besides dealing reactively to individual bugs and existing maintenance needs, there is also the need to proactively eliminate entire classes of flaws, so developers cannot introduce these types of bugs ever again. Why fix the same kind of security vulnerability 10 times a year when we can stop it from ever appearing again?<br /><br />Over the last few years, various fragile language features and kernel APIs have been eliminated or replaced (e.g. <a href=""https://git.kernel.org/linus/0bb95f80a38f82884693194ea720e9cca5e12ada"">VLAs</a>, <a href=""https://git.kernel.org/linus/a035d552a93bb9ef6048733bb9f2a0dc857ff869"">switch fallthrough</a>, <a href=""https://git.kernel.org/linus/3d2403fd10a1dbb359b154af41ffed9f2a7520e8"">addr_limit</a>). However, there is still plenty <a href=""https://github.com/KSPP/linux/issues"">more work to be done</a>. One of the most time-consuming aspects has been the refactoring involved in making these usually invasive and context-sensitive changes across Linux's 25 million lines of code.<br /><br />Beyond kernel code itself, the compiler and toolchain also need to grow more defensive features (e.g. <a href=""https://git.kernel.org/linus/f0fe00d4972a8cd4b98cc2c29758615e4d51cdfe"">variable zeroing</a>, <a href=""https://source.android.com/devices/tech/debug/kcfi"">CFI</a>, <a href=""https://bugzilla.kernel.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=__open__&amp;component=Sanitizers&amp;list_id=1093987&amp;product=Memory%20Management"">sanitizers</a>). With the toolchain technically ""outside"" the kernel, its development effort is often inappropriately overlooked and underinvested. Code safety burdens need to be shifted as much as possible to the toolchain, freeing humans to work in other areas. On the most progressive front, we must make sure Linux can be written in memory-safe languages like <a href=""https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210704202756.29107-1-ojeda@kernel.org/"">Rust</a>.<br /></div><div><h3 style=""text-align: left;"">Don't wait another <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRee26pfVzU#t=11"">minute</a></h3>If you're not using the latest kernel, you don't have the most recently added security defenses (including bug fixes). In the face of newly discovered flaws, this leaves systems less secure than they could have been. Even when mediated by careful system design, proper threat modeling, and other standard security practices, the magnitude of risk grows quickly over time, leaving vendors to do the calculus of determining how old a kernel they can tolerate exposing users to. Unless the answer is ""just abandon our users,"" engineering resources must be focused upstream on closing the gap by continuously deploying the latest kernel release.<br /><br />Based on our most conservative estimates, the Linux kernel and its toolchains are currently underinvested by at least 100 engineers, so it's up to everyone to bring their developer talent together upstream. This is the only solution that will ensure a balance of security at reasonable long-term cost.<div><span id=""docs-internal-guid-06a3ae60-7fff-c3be-2f2a-2f74fe68730b""><br /></span></div></div><div class=""feedflare"">

For example, instead of 10 companies each assigning one engineer to backport the same fix independently, those developer hours could be shifted to upstream work where 10 separate bugs could be fixed for everyone in the Linux ecosystem. This would help address the growing backlog of bugs.

Looking at just one source of potential kernel security flaws, the syzkaller dashboard shows the number of open bugs is currently approaching 900 and growing by about 100 a year , even with about 400 a year being fixed.

Capable code review bandwidth is a limited resource. Without enough people dedicated to upstream code review and subsystem maintenance tasks, the entire kernel development process bottlenecks.Long-term Linux robustness depends on developers, but especially on effective kernel maintainers . Although there is effort in the industry to train new developers, this has been traditionally justified only by the ""feature driven"" jobs they can get. But focusing only on product timelines ultimately leads Linux into the Tragedy of the Commons . Expanding the number of maintainers can avoid it . Luckily the ""pipeline"" for new maintainers is straightforward.Maintainers are built not only from their depth of knowledge of a subsystem's technology, but also from their experience with mentorship of other developers and code review.

More engineers for testing and infrastructure

More engineers for security and toolchain development Besides dealing reactively to individual bugs and existing maintenance needs, there is also the need to proactively eliminate entire classes of flaws, so developers cannot introduce these types of bugs ever again. Why fix the same kind of security vulnerability 10 times a year when we can stop it from ever appearing again?

Why fix the same kind of security vulnerability 10 times a year when we can stop it from ever appearing again?Over the last few years, various fragile language features and kernel APIs have been eliminated or replaced (e.g. VLAs addr_limit ). However, there is still plenty more work to be done . One of the most time-consuming aspects has been the refactoring involved in making these usually invasive and context-sensitive changes across Linux's 25 million lines of code.Beyond kernel code itself, the compiler and toolchain also need to grow more defensive features (e.g. variable zeroing sanitizers ). With the toolchain technically ""outside"" the kernel, its development effort is often inappropriately overlooked and underinvested. Code safety burdens need to be shifted as much as possible to the toolchain, freeing humans to work in other areas. On the most progressive front, we must make sure Linux can be written in memory-safe languages like Rust"

To help improve female representation in the cybersecurity industry, Google teamed up with <a href=""https://www.wicys.org/"">Women in Cybersecurity (WiCyS)</a> and <a href=""https://www.sans.org/"">SANS Institute</a> a year ago to establish the <a href=""https://www.wicys.org/benefits/security-training-scholarship/"">Security Training Scholarship Program</a>. <br /><br />The multi-stage security training program set participants on a path to launch and advance their careers in cybersecurity through skills development, introducing them to fundamental cybersecurity concepts with interactive challenges like Capture the Flag (CTF) and the SANS CyberStart Game, which introduces topics such as Linux, web attacks, programming, forensics, and more. Mentors and peers guide the participants through each stage of the program and top qualifiers then graduate and receive access to the SANS foundational security training courses, which readies and prepares these women for their first roles in the security industry. The goal is to get them employed in cybersecurity within the next 1.5 years and to create a powerful network of women in the field – in essence, drawing more women to the industry and helping to close the talent gap.<br /><br /><br />As the inaugural program comes to an end, we are proud to report that its overall impact includes: <br /><br /><br /><ul style=""text-align: left;""><li>112 people received training-based scholarship</li><li>15 Full Scholarship Recipients received the full course training, which includes:</li><ul><li>CyberStart Game and SANS BootUp CTF</li><li>SANS SEC275 Foundations &amp; Exam</li><li>SANS 401 Security Essentials Bootcamp and GSEC</li><li>Elective - SANS SEC504/GCIH, SEC488/GCLD, SEC560/GPEN, or SEC548/GWAPT</li></ul><li>24 certifications earned to date with 100% pass rate, with average score on GSEC 90%</li><li>Since 2013, only 2 people have scored 99% on GIAC Certified Incident Handler (GCIH) one is a WiCyS Scholarship Recipient</li><li>1/3  of students were employed in direct information security roles before the program ended</li><li>100% of Full Scholarship Recipients intend to have long term careers in information security (15+ years)</li></ul>Participants praise the program’s strong networking component where they can support one another, share best practices, ask questions from SANS security experts and receive industry insight from members across Google’s security team. As Lynn Dohm, executive director of WiCyS, told us, “You cannot put a price tag on the power of community, and last year’s WiCyS Security Training Program proved just that.” <br /><br />Here at Google, we are inspired by the dedication and passion the scholarship recipients have shown throughout the program and are eager to see what they accomplish throughout their careers.<br /><br />Elizabeth Beattie, who was part of the inaugural program told us, “I learned that, as part of my scholarship program with WiCyS, SANS Institute and Google, I’ve been awarded a scholarship to attend the WiCyS 2021 conference in September. In fact, I’ve volunteered to co-author a panel there with some of my amazing fellow recipients. And the crowning achievement? Tonight, I passed my first GIAC certification (GSEC)!”<br /><br />Despite these great results, we know there is still a lot of work to be done to help educate and develop a more inclusive information security workforce. So this year we are expanding the Security Trainings Scholarship Program to help us reach even more women and generate a steady stream of talent in the field of information security. This expansion would not have been possible without the added support of Facebook and Bloomberg, who have come on board this year to boost this important program.<br /><br />“We are thrilled to scale the program this year, powered by scholarships from Google, Bloomberg, and Facebook,” said Dohm. “Now, more WiCyS members will be able to dive deep and change the trajectory of their career in less than a year, all within a cohort setting with extensive support and resources provided by mentors and colleagues. That’s what empowerment looks like, and we are thrilled that these three incredible strategic partners of WiCyS can make this happen for not only the WiCyS community, but also for the sake of the cybersecurity workforce at large.”<br /><br />The next round of scholarships is open through August 2, 2021.

Just as we now think of security as something we build into software from the start, we are also increasingly looking for new ways to minimize trust in that software. One of the ways we can do that is by designing software so that you can get cryptographic certainty of what the software has done.<br /><br />In this post, we'll introduce the concept of <a href=""https://transparency.dev/verifiable-data-structures/"">verifiable data structures</a> that help us get this cryptographic certainty. We'll describe some existing and new applications of verifiable data structures, and provide some additional resources we have created to help you use them in your own applications. <br />A verifiable data structure is a class of data structure that lets people efficiently agree, with cryptographic certainty, that the data contained within it is correct.<br /><br /><a href=""https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/merkle-tree/m07h_v_"">Merkle Trees</a> are the most famous of these and have been used for decades because they can enable efficient verification that a particular piece of data is included among many records - as a result they also form the basis of most blockchains. <br /><br />Although these verifiable data structures are not new, we now have a new generation of developers who have discovered them and the designs they enable -- further accelerating their adoption. <br />These verifiable data structures enable building a new class of software that have elements of verifiability and transparency built into the way they operate. This gives us new ways to defend against coercion, introduce accountability to existing and new ecosystems, and make it easier to demonstrate compliance to regulators, customers and partners.<br /><br /><a href=""https://certificate.transparency.dev/"">Certificate Transparency</a> is a great example of a non-blockchain use of these verifiable data structures at scale to secure core internet infrastructure. By using these patterns, we have been able to <a href=""https://certificate.transparency.dev/community/"">introduce transparency and accountability</a> to an existing system used by everyone without <a href=""https://research.google/pubs/pub47551/"">breaking the web</a>.<br />Unfortunately, despite the capabilities of verifiable data structures and the associated patterns, there are not many resources developers can use to design, build, and deploy scalable and production-quality systems based on them. <br /><br />To address this gap we have generalized the <a href=""https://github.com/google/trillian"">platform</a> we used to build Certificate Transparency so it can be applied to other classes of problems as well. Since this infrastructure has been used for years as part of this ecosystem it is well understood and can be deployed confidently in production systems. <br />This is why we have seen solutions in areas of healthcare, financial services, and supply chain leverage this platform. Beyond that, we have also applied these patterns to bring these transparency and accountability properties to other problems within our own products and services. <br /><br />To this end, in 2019, we used this platform to bring supply chain integrity to the Go language ecosystem via the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqTySYYhPUE"">Go Checksum Database</a>. This system allows developers to have confidence that the package management systems supporting the Go ecosystem can’t intentionally, arbitrarily, or accidentally start giving out the wrong code without getting caught. The reproducibility of Go builds makes this particularly powerful as it enables the developer to ensure what is in the source repository matches what is in the package management system. This solution delivers a verifiable chaiin all the way from the source repositories to the final compiled artifacts.<br /><br />Another example of using these patterns is our recently <a href=""https://security.googleblog.com/2021/03/introducing-sigstore-easy-code-signing.html"">announced</a> partnership with the Linux Foundation on <a href=""https://sigstore.dev/"">Sigstore</a>. This project is a response to the ever-increasing influx of supply chain attacks on the Open Source ecosystem. <br /><br />Supply chain attacks have been possible because there are weaknesses at every link in the chain. Components like build systems, source code management tools, and artifact repositories all need to be treated as critical production environments, because they are. To address this, we first need to make it possible to verify provenance along the entire chain and the goal of the Sigstore effort is to enable just that.<br /><br />We are now working on using these patterns and tools to <a href=""https://github.com/google/trillian-examples/tree/master/binary_transparency/firmware"">enable hardware-enforced supply chain integrity for device firmware</a>, which we hope will discourage supply chain attacks on the devices, like smartphones, that we rely on every day by bringing transparency and accountability to their firmware supply chain.<br /><br />In all of the above examples, we are using these verifiable data structures to ensure the integrity of artifacts in the supply chain. This enables customers, auditors, and internal security teams to be confident that each actor in the supply chain has lived up to their responsibilities. This helps earn the trust of those that rely on the supply chain, discourages insiders from using their position as it increases the chance they will get caught, introduces accountability, and enables proving the associated systems continually meet their compliance obligations.<br /><br />When using these patterns the most important task is defining what data should be logged. This is why we put together a <a href=""https://transparency.dev/how-to-design-a-verifiable-system/"">taxonomy and modeling framework </a>which we have found to be helpful in designing verifiability into the systems we discussed above, and which we hope you will find valuable too.<br />Please take a look at the <a href=""http://transparency.dev/"">transparency.dev</a> website to learn about these verifiable data structures, and the tools and guidance we have put together to help use them in your own applications.<div class=""feedflare"">

We have added new security checks, scaled up the number of projects being scored, and made this data easily accessible for analysis.<br /><br /><br />With so much software today relying on open-source projects, consumers need an easy way to judge whether their dependencies are safe. Scorecards helps reduce the toil and manual effort required to continually evaluate changing packages when maintaining a project’s supply chain. Consumers can automatically assess the risks that dependencies introduce and use this data to make informed decisions about accepting these risks, evaluating alternative solutions, or working with the maintainers to make improvements.<div><br /></div><br /><h3 style=""text-align: left;"">Identifying Risks</h3><br />Since last fall, Scorecards’ coverage has grown; we've added several new checks, following the <a href=""https://security.googleblog.com/2021/02/know-prevent-fix-framework-for-shifting.html"">Know, Prevent, Fix framework</a> proposed by Google earlier this year, to prioritize our additions:<br /><br /><div><b>Malicious contributors</b><br /><br />Contributors with malicious intent or compromised accounts can introduce potential backdoors into code. Code reviews help mitigate against such attacks. With the new <a href=""https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/checks/checks.md#branch-protection"">Branch-Protection</a> check, developers can verify that the project enforces mandatory code review from another developer before code is committed. Currently, this check can only be run by a repository admin due to GitHub API limitations. For a third-party repository, use the less informative <a href=""https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/checks/checks.md#code-review"">Code-Review</a> check instead.<br /><br /></div><div><b>Vulnerable code<br /></b><br />Despite best efforts by developers and peer reviews, vulnerable code can enter source control and remain undetected. That’s why it's important to enable continuous fuzzing and static code analysis to catch bugs early in the development lifecycle. We have added checks to detect if a project uses <a href=""https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/checks/checks.md#fuzzing"">Fuzzing</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/checks/checks.md#sast"">SAST</a> tools as part of their CI/CD system.<br /><b><br /></b></div><div><b>Build system compromise</b><br /><br />A common CI/CD solution used by GitHub projects is <a href=""https://github.com/features/actions"">GitHub Actions</a>. A danger with these action workflows is that they may handle untrusted user input. Meaning, an attacker can craft a malicious pull request to gain access to the privileged GitHub token, and with it the ability to <a href=""https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/heres-how-a-researcher-broke-into-microsoft-vs-codes-github/"">push malicious code to the repo</a> without review. To mitigate this risk, Scorecard's <a href=""https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/checks/checks.md#token-permissions"">Token-Permissions</a> prevention check now verifies that the GitHub workflows follow the principle of least privilege by making GitHub tokens read-only by default.<br /><br /></div><div><b>Bad dependencies</b><br /><br />Any software is as secure as its weakest dependency. This may sound obvious, but the first step to knowing our dependencies is simply to declare them... and have our dependencies declare them too. Once we have this provenance information, we can assess the risks of our software and mitigate those risks. Unfortunately, there are several widely-used anti-patterns that break this provenance principle. The first of these anti-patterns is checked-in binaries -- as there's no way to easily verify or check the contents of the binary in the project. Scorecards provides <a href=""https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/checks/checks.md#binary-artifacts"">Binary-Artifacts</a> check for testing this.<br /><br /><br />Another anti-pattern is the use of curl | bash in scripts which dynamically pulls dependencies. Cryptographic hashes let us pin our dependencies to a known value: if this value ever changes, the build system will detect it and refuse to build. Pinning dependencies is useful everywhere we have dependencies: not just during compilation, but also in Dockerfiles, CI/CD workflows, etc. Scorecards checks for these anti-patterns with the <a href=""https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/checks/checks.md#frozen-deps"">Frozen-Deps</a> check. This check is helpful for mitigating against malicious dependency attacks such as the recent <a href=""https://about.codecov.io/security-update/"">CodeCov</a> attack.<br /><br /><br />Even with hash-pinning, hashes need to be updated once in a while when dependencies patch vulnerabilities. Tools like <a href=""https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/managing-vulnerabilities-in-your-projects-dependencies/configuring-dependabot-security-updates"">dependabot</a> or <a href=""https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate"">renovatebot</a> give us the opportunity to review and update the hashes. The Scorecards <a href=""https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/checks/checks.md#automatic-dependency-update"">Automated-Dependency-Update</a> check verifies that developers rely on such tools to update their dependencies.<br /><br /><br />It is important to know vulnerabilities in a project before uptaking it as a dependency. Scorecards can provide this information via the new <a href=""https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/checks/checks.md#vulnerabilities"">Vulnerabilities</a> check, without the need to subscribe to a vulnerability alert system.</div><div><br /></div><div><span id=""docs-internal-guid-5a5e70ca-7fff-d253-cfe3-6f935c47390e""><br /></span><h3 style=""text-align: left;""><span>Scaling the impact</span></h3><span><br />To date, the Scorecards project has scaled up to evaluate security criteria for over <a href=""https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/cron/data/projects.csv"">50,000</a> open source projects. In order to scale this project, we undertook a massive redesign of our architecture and used a PubSub model which achieved horizontal scalability and higher throughput. This fully automated tool periodically evaluates critical open source projects and exposes the Scorecards check information through a <a href=""https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?p=openssf&amp;page=table&amp;d=scorecardcron&amp;t=scorecard"">public BigQuery dataset</a> which is refreshed weekly.</span></div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5m_2mgrQ3mw/YN0HDhdyQcI/AAAAAAAAAVE/GpZWDDE0qq4HlWxQH5FJ8rrSs-74eBe_QCNcBGAsYHQ/s960/Scorecards%2BUpdate%2BBlog%2BPost_%2BMeasuring%2BSecurity%2BRisk%2Bin%2BOpen%2BSource%2BSoftware.jpg"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" height=""300"" src=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5m_2mgrQ3mw/YN0HDhdyQcI/AAAAAAAAAVE/GpZWDDE0qq4HlWxQH5FJ8rrSs-74eBe_QCNcBGAsYHQ/w400-h300/Scorecards%2BUpdate%2BBlog%2BPost_%2BMeasuring%2BSecurity%2BRisk%2Bin%2BOpen%2BSource%2BSoftware.jpg"" width=""400"" /></a></div><br /><span><br /></span></div><div>This data can be retrieved using the <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/bq-cli-reference"">bq command line tool</a>.

A large number of these projects are not continuously <a href=""https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz"">fuzzed</a>, do not define a security policy for reporting vulnerabilities, and do not pin dependencies, to name just a few common problems.

Since then, pull requests introducing new dependencies to Envoy must get approval from a dependency maintainer who uses Scorecards to <a href=""https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/main/DEPENDENCY_POLICY.md#new-external-dependencies"">evaluate</a> the dependency against a set of criteria.  <br /><br />In addition, Envoy also got right to work in improving its own security health metrics according to its own Scorecards evaluation, and is now pinning C++ dependencies and <a href=""https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/12951"">requiring</a> pip hashes for python dependencies. <a href=""https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/16579"">Github actions</a> are also pinned in the continuous integration flow.<br /><br />Previously, Envoy had created a <a href=""https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/main/tools/dependency/ossf_scorecard.py"">tool</a> that outputs Scorecards data on its dependencies as a CSV that can be used to generate a table of results:<br /><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""><span style=""border: none; display: inline-block; height: 250px; overflow: hidden; width: 486px;""><img height=""310.1987210556763"" src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/YqcstmQ3VDTxdiBJ7kYPWQb9McOreST9vD5g3eb_5FVuUAZTy4JwfES1T0boins0JfTiAeB1mHUNkW35hHJ_qVbJbCETXMkb3heYTWyvatxnkMGExmc0HDTnoe1kEjIbkOHpWH7W3I-lH7FpchKe2B924zsmvvJw-PbVVrpjeMvawwiu"" style=""margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"" width=""486"" /></span></span></p><br /><br /></span></div><div><span>Now with more project data, Envoy is able to automatically generate up-to-date Scorecard information about its dependencies and publish it in <a href=""https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/security/external_deps"">documentation</a>, like the following:</span></div><div><br /><span><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""><span style=""border: none; display: inline-block; height: 324px; overflow: hidden; width: 672px;""><img height=""324"" src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/tY8dmWzP8B4uNp7M7QuVpeeJ_Baej0oeFvJ9zZ1w4DOvFxdLZOO1WCWWiy-0Lh_3HMFNOwPrNeC5PKjGrer1rFi7XidXiKy_IY7U-hogQys-LSO-BV8g51hxOISKUtNq5iBUMmu8FONWjyQuA1eSmH-j1jSaanrBHDZQpMTes3RLpE4m"" style=""margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"" width=""672"" /></span></span></p><br /><b>Scorecards</b><br />We improved our own score for the Scorecards!

Contributors with malicious intent or compromised accounts can introduce potential backdoors into code. Code reviews help mitigate against such attacks. With the new Branch-Protection check, developers can verify that the project enforces mandatory code review from another developer before code is committed. Currently, this check can only be run by a repository admin due to GitHub API limitations. For a third-party repository, use the less informative Code-Review check instead.

Vulnerable code



Despite best efforts by developers and peer reviews, vulnerable code can enter source control and remain undetected. That’s why it's important to enable continuous fuzzing and static code analysis to catch bugs early in the development lifecycle. We have added checks to detect if a project uses



Despite best efforts by developers and peer reviews, vulnerable code can enter source control and remain undetected. That’s why it's important to enable continuous fuzzing and static code analysis to catch bugs early in the development lifecycle. We have added checks to detect if a project uses Fuzzing and SAST tools as part of their CI/CD system.

Build system compromise



A common CI/CD solution used by GitHub projects is



A common CI/CD solution used by GitHub projects is GitHub Actions . A danger with these action workflows is that they may handle untrusted user input. Meaning, an attacker can craft a malicious pull request to gain access to the privileged GitHub token, and with it the ability to push malicious code to the repo without review. To mitigate this risk, Scorecard's Token-Permissions prevention check now verifies that the GitHub workflows follow the principle of least privilege by making GitHub tokens read-only by default.

Bad dependencies



Any software is as secure as its weakest dependency. This may sound obvious, but the first step to knowing our dependencies is simply to declare them... and have our dependencies declare them too. Once we have this provenance information, we can assess the risks of our software and mitigate those risks. Unfortunately, there are several widely-used anti-patterns that break this provenance principle. The first of these anti-patterns is checked-in binaries -- as there's no way to easily verify or check the contents of the binary in the project. Scorecards provides





Another anti-pattern is the use of curl | bash in scripts which dynamically pulls dependencies. Cryptographic hashes let us pin our dependencies to a known value: if this value ever changes, the build system will detect it and refuse to build. Pinning dependencies is useful everywhere we have dependencies: not just during compilation, but also in Dockerfiles, CI/CD workflows, etc. Scorecards checks for these anti-patterns with the





Even with hash-pinning, hashes need to be updated once in a while when dependencies patch vulnerabilities. Tools like

Pinning dependencies is useful everywhere we have dependencies: not just during compilation, but also in Dockerfiles, CI/CD workflows, etc. Scorecards checks for these anti-patterns with the Frozen-Deps check. This check is helpful for mitigating against malicious dependency attacks such as the recent CodeCov attack.Even with hash-pinning, hashes need to be updated once in a while when dependencies patch vulnerabilities. Tools like dependabot or renovatebot give us the opportunity to review and update the hashes. The Scorecards Automated-Dependency-Update check verifies that developers rely on such tools to update their dependencies.It is important to know vulnerabilities in a project before uptaking it as a dependency. Scorecards can provide this information via the new Vulnerabilities check, without the need to subscribe to a vulnerability alert system.







Scaling the impact

To date, the Scorecards project has scaled up to evaluate security criteria for over To date, the Scorecards project has scaled up to evaluate security criteria for over 50,000 open source projects. In order to scale this project, we undertook a massive redesign of our architecture and used a PubSub model which achieved horizontal scalability and higher throughput. This fully automated tool periodically evaluates critical open source projects and exposes the Scorecards check information through a public BigQuery dataset which is refreshed weekly.





This data can be retrieved using the bq command line tool . The following example shows how to export data for the Kubernetes project. Substitute the url for the repo to export data from a different project:



$ bq query --nouse_legacy_sql 'SELECT Repo, Date, Checks FROM openssf.scorecardcron.scorecard_latest WHERE Repo=""github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes""'

To export the latest data on all analyzed projects, see instructions

As we can see, a lot needs to be done to improve the security of these critical projects. A large number of these projects are not continuously fuzzed , do not define a security policy for reporting vulnerabilities, and do not pin dependencies, to name just a few common problems. We all need to come together as an industry to drive awareness of these widespread security risks, and to make improvements that will benefit everyone.

Early on we talked about how the Envoy maintainers adopted Scorecards for their project and integrated it within their policy on introducing new dependencies. Since then, pull requests introducing new dependencies to Envoy must get approval from a dependency maintainer who uses Scorecards to evaluate the dependency against a set of criteria.In addition, Envoy also got right to work in improving its own security health metrics according to its own Scorecards evaluation, and is now pinning C++ dependencies and requiring pip hashes for python dependencies. Github actions are also pinned in the continuous integration flow.Previously, Envoy had created a tool that outputs Scorecards data on its dependencies as a CSV that can be used to generate a table of results:

One important focus is improving how we identify and respond to known security vulnerabilities without doing extensive manual work. It is essential to have a precise common data format to triage and remediate security vulnerabilities, particularly when communicating about risks to affected dependencies—it enables easier automation and empowers consumers of open-source software to know when they are impacted and make security fixes as soon as possible.<br /><br />We released the <a href=""https://opensource.googleblog.com/2021/02/launching-osv-better-vulnerability.html"">Open Source Vulnerabilities (OSV) database</a> in February with the goal of automating and improving vulnerability triage for developers and users of open source software. This initial effort was bootstrapped with a dataset of a few thousand vulnerabilities from the <a href=""https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz"">OSS-Fuzz</a> project. Implementing OSV to communicate precise vulnerability data for hundreds of critical open-source projects proved the success and utility of the format, and garnered feedback to help us improve the project; for example, we dropped the Cloud API key requirement, making the database even easier to access by more users. The community response also showed that there was broad interest in extending the effort further.<br /><br />Today, we’re excited to announce a new milestone in expanding OSV to several key open-source ecosystems: <a href=""https://github.com/golang/vulndb"">Go</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db"">Rust</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/pypa/advisory-db"">Python</a>, and <a href=""https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/dwflist"">DWF</a>. This expansion unites and aggregates four important vulnerability databases, giving software developers a better way to track and remediate the security issues that affect them. Our effort also aligns with the recent <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/05/17/2021-10460/improving-the-nations-cybersecurity"">US Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity</a>, which emphasized the need to remove barriers to sharing threat information in order to strengthen national infrastructure. This expanded shared vulnerability database marks an important step toward creating a more secure open-source environment for all users.<div>&nbsp; <br /><b>A simple, unified schema for describing vulnerabilities precisely</b><br /><br />As with open source development, vulnerability databases in open source follow a distributed model, with many ecosystems and organizations creating their own database. Since each uses their own format to describe vulnerabilities, a client tracking vulnerabilities across multiple databases must handle each completely separately. Sharing of vulnerabilities between databases is also difficult.<br /><br />The Google Open Source Security team, Go team, and the broader open-source community have been developing a simple <a href=""https://tinyurl.com/vuln-json"">vulnerability interchange schema</a> for describing vulnerabilities that’s designed from the beginning for open-source ecosystems. After starting work on the schema a few months ago, we <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/vuln-json"">requested public feedback and received hundreds of comments</a>. We have incorporated the input from readers to arrive at the current schema:<div><br /><div><span id=""docs-internal-guid-ed5a238f-7fff-2b6d-1566-a048811a11fd""><div align=""left"" dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-left: 0pt;""><table style=""border-collapse: collapse;

This new vulnerability schema aims to address some key problems with managing vulnerabilities in open source. We found that there was no existing standard format which:



Enforces version specification that precisely matches naming and versioning schemes used in actual open source package ecosystems. For instance, matching a vulnerability such as a CVE to a package name and set of versions in a package manager is difficult to do in an automated way using existing mechanisms such as CPEs

Can be used to describe vulnerabilities in any open source ecosystem, while not requiring ecosystem-dependent logic to process them.

Is easy to use by both automated systems and humans.

With this schema we hope to define a format that all vulnerability databases can export. A unified format means that vulnerability databases, open source users, and security researchers can easily share tooling and consume vulnerabilities across all of open source. This means a more complete view of vulnerabilities in open source for everyone, as well as faster detection and remediation times resulting from easier automation.

As with open source development, vulnerability databases in open source follow a distributed model, with many ecosystems and organizations creating their own database. Since each uses their own format to describe vulnerabilities, a client tracking vulnerabilities across multiple databases must handle each completely separately. Sharing of vulnerabilities between databases is also difficult.The Google Open Source Security team, Go team, and the broader open-source community have been developing a simple vulnerability interchange schema for describing vulnerabilities that’s designed from the beginning for open-source ecosystems. After starting work on the schema a few months ago, we requested public feedback and received hundreds of comments . We have incorporated the input from readers to arrive at the current schema:"

The software development and deployment supply chain is quite complicated, with numerous threats along the source ➞ build ➞ publish workflow. While point solutions do exist for some specific vulnerabilities, there is no comprehensive end-to-end framework that both defines how to mitigate threats across the software supply chain, and provides reasonable security guarantees. There is an urgent need for a solution in the face of the eye-opening, multi-billion dollar attacks in recent months (e.g. <a href=""https://www.solarwinds.com/sa-overview/securityadvisory"">SolarWinds</a>, <a href=""https://about.codecov.io/security-update/"">Codecov</a>), some of which could have been prevented or made more difficult had such a framework been adopted by software developers and consumers.<br /><br /><br />Our proposed solution is <a href=""https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa"">Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts</a> (SLSA, pronounced “salsa”), an end-to-end framework for ensuring the integrity of software artifacts throughout the software supply chain. It is inspired by Google’s internal “<a href=""https://cloud.google.com/security/binary-authorization-for-borg"">Binary Authorization for Borg</a>” which has been in use for the past 8+ years and is mandatory for all of Google's production workloads. The goal of SLSA is to improve the state of the industry, particularly open source, to defend against the most pressing integrity threats. With SLSA, consumers can make informed choices about the security posture of the software they consume.<b><br /><br /></b></div><div><b>How SLSA helps</b><br /><br />SLSA helps to protect against common supply chain attacks. The following image illustrates a typical software supply chain and includes examples of attacks that can occur at every link in the chain.

In its final form, SLSA will differ from a list of best practices in its enforceability: it will support the automatic creation of auditable metadata that can be fed into policy engines to give ""SLSA certification"" to a particular package or build platform. SLSA is designed to be incremental and actionable, and to provide security benefits at every step. Once an artifact qualifies at the highest level, consumers can have confidence that it has not been tampered with and can be securely traced back to source—something that is difficult, if not impossible, to do with most software today.<br /><br />SLSA consists of four levels, with SLSA 4 representing the ideal end state. The lower levels represent incremental milestones with corresponding incremental integrity guarantees. The requirements are currently defined as follows.<span><br /><p dir=""ltr"" style=""line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: center;""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""><span style=""border: none; display: inline-block; height: 566px; overflow: hidden; width: 446px;""><img height=""566"" src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/xImMHmA4tgKvLidz2YQEglPLz_Oz1ynorznP3mcRpGZ7zqBv4KeV4SDFXf4fROCIlm8qTBDhKemZHSJlXnZC_fck598S6lImbBpowD_PgP_PROV4ObqnjieqT3LP7b8kf97r_089c9LOp1FqRFPBvKKKMyr8J6EPHXLrsm5ZCruzqIJ8"" style=""margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"" width=""446"" /></span></span></p></span><br /><br /><b>SLSA 1</b> requires that the build process be fully scripted/automated and generate provenance. Provenance is metadata about how an artifact was built, including the build process, top-level source, and dependencies. Knowing the provenance allows software consumers to make risk-based security decisions. Though provenance at SLSA 1 does not protect against tampering, it offers a basic level of code source identification and may aid in vulnerability management.<br /><br /><br /><b>SLSA 2&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>requires using version control and a hosted build service that generates authenticated provenance. These additional requirements give the consumer greater confidence in the origin of the software. At this level, the provenance prevents tampering to the extent that the build service is trusted. SLSA 2 also provides an easy upgrade path to SLSA 3.<br /><br /><br /><b>SLSA 3</b> further requires that the source and build platforms meet specific standards to guarantee the auditability of the source and the integrity of the provenance, respectively. We envision an accreditation process whereby auditors certify that platforms meet the requirements, which consumers can then rely on. SLSA 3 provides much stronger protections against tampering than earlier levels by preventing specific classes of threats, such as cross-build contamination.<br /><br /><br /><b>SLSA 4</b> is currently the highest level, requiring two-person review of all changes and a hermetic, reproducible build process. Two-person review is an industry best practice for catching mistakes and deterring bad behavior. Hermetic builds guarantee that the provenance’s list of dependencies is complete. Reproducible builds, though not strictly required, provide many auditability and reliability benefits. Overall, SLSA 4 gives the consumer a high degree of confidence that the software has not been tampered with.<br /><br /><br />More details on these proposed levels can be found in the <a href=""https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa"">GitHub repository</a>, including the corresponding Source and Build/Provenance <a href=""https://slsa.dev/"">requirements</a>. We are open to feedback and suggestions for changes on these requirements.</div><div><br /><b>Proof of Concept</b><br /><br />Today, we are releasing a proof of concept for SLSA 1 provenance generator (<a href=""https://github.com/slsa-framework/github-actions-demo"">repo</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/marketplace/actions/slsa-build-provenance-action-demo"">marketplace</a>). This will allow a user to create and upload provenance alongside their build artifacts, thereby achieving SLSA 1.

These plans include generating provenance automatically in build systems, propagating provenance natively in package repositories, and adding security features across the major platforms.

Supply chain integrity attacks—unauthorized modifications to software packages—have been





Our proposed solution is



Supply chain integrity attacks—unauthorized modifications to software packages—have been on the rise in the past two years, and are proving to be common and reliable attack vectors that affect all consumers of software. The software development and deployment supply chain is quite complicated, with numerous threats along the source ➞ build ➞ publish workflow. While point solutions do exist for some specific vulnerabilities, there is no comprehensive end-to-end framework that both defines how to mitigate threats across the software supply chain, and provides reasonable security guarantees. There is an urgent need for a solution in the face of the eye-opening, multi-billion dollar attacks in recent months (e.g. SolarWinds Codecov ), some of which could have been prevented or made more difficult had such a framework been adopted by software developers and consumers.Our proposed solution is Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA, pronounced “salsa”), an end-to-end framework for ensuring the integrity of software artifacts throughout the software supply chain. It is inspired by Google’s internal “ Binary Authorization for Borg ” which has been in use for the past 8+ years and is mandatory for all of Google's production workloads. The goal of SLSA is to improve the state of the industry, particularly open source, to defend against the most pressing integrity threats. With SLSA, consumers can make informed choices about the security posture of the software they consume.

How SLSA helps



SLSA helps to protect against common supply chain attacks. The following image illustrates a typical software supply chain and includes examples of attacks that can occur at every link in the chain. Each type of attack has occured over the past several years and, unfortunately, is increasing as time goes on.









Threat Known example How SLSA could have helped A Submit bad code to the source repository Linux hypocrite commits: Researcher attempted to intentionally introduce vulnerabilities into the Linux kernel via patches on the mailing list. Two-person review caught most, but not all, of the vulnerabilities. B Compromise source control platform PHP: Attacker compromised PHP’s self-hosted git server and injected two malicious commits. A better-protected source code platform would have been a much harder target for the attackers. C Build with official process but from code not matching source control Webmin: Attacker modified the build infrastructure to use source files not matching source control. A SLSA-compliant build server would have produced provenance identifying the actual sources used, allowing consumers to detect such tampering. D Compromise build platform SolarWinds: Attacker compromised the build platform and installed an implant that injected malicious behavior during each build. Higher SLSA levels require stronger security controls for the build platform, making it more difficult to compromise and gain persistence. E Use bad dependency (i.e. A-H, recursively) event-stream: Attacker added an innocuous dependency and then updated the dependency to add malicious behavior. The update did not match the code submitted to GitHub (i.e. attack F). Applying SLSA recursively to all dependencies would have prevented this particular vector, because the provenance would have indicated that it either wasn’t built from a proper builder or that the source did not come from GitHub. F Upload an artifact that was not built by the CI/CD system CodeCov: Attacker used leaked credentials to upload a malicious artifact to a GCS bucket, from which users download directly. Provenance of the artifact in the GCS bucket would have shown that the artifact was not built in the expected manner from the expected source repo. G Compromise package repository Attacks on Package Mirrors: Researcher ran mirrors for several popular package repositories, which could have been used to serve malicious packages. Similar to above (F), provenance of the malicious artifacts would have shown that they were not built as expected or from the expected source repo. H Trick consumer into using bad package Browserify typosquatting: Attacker uploaded a malicious package with a similar name as the original. SLSA does not directly address this threat, but provenance linking back to source control can enable and enhance other solutions.

What is SLSA



In its current state, SLSA is a set of incrementally adoptable security guidelines being established by industry consensus. In its final form, SLSA will differ from a list of best practices in its enforceability: it will support the automatic creation of auditable metadata that can be fed into policy engines to give ""SLSA certification"" to a particular package or build platform. SLSA is designed to be incremental and actionable, and to provide security benefits at every step. Once an artifact qualifies at the highest level, consumers can have confidence that it has not been tampered with and can be securely traced back to source—something that is difficult, if not impossible, to do with most software today.



SLSA consists of four levels, with SLSA 4 representing the ideal end state. The lower levels represent incremental milestones with corresponding incremental integrity guarantees. The requirements are currently defined as follows.





SLSA 1 requires that the build process be fully scripted/automated and generate provenance. Provenance is metadata about how an artifact was built, including the build process, top-level source, and dependencies. Knowing the provenance allows software consumers to make risk-based security decisions. Though provenance at SLSA 1 does not protect against tampering, it offers a basic level of code source identification and may aid in vulnerability management.





SLSA 2 requires using version control and a hosted build service that generates authenticated provenance. These additional requirements give the consumer greater confidence in the origin of the software. At this level, the provenance prevents tampering to the extent that the build service is trusted. SLSA 2 also provides an easy upgrade path to SLSA 3.





SLSA 3 further requires that the source and build platforms meet specific standards to guarantee the auditability of the source and the integrity of the provenance, respectively. We envision an accreditation process whereby auditors certify that platforms meet the requirements, which consumers can then rely on. SLSA 3 provides much stronger protections against tampering than earlier levels by preventing specific classes of threats, such as cross-build contamination.





SLSA 4 is currently the highest level, requiring two-person review of all changes and a hermetic, reproducible build process. Two-person review is an industry best practice for catching mistakes and deterring bad behavior. Hermetic builds guarantee that the provenance’s list of dependencies is complete. Reproducible builds, though not strictly required, provide many auditability and reliability benefits. Overall, SLSA 4 gives the consumer a high degree of confidence that the software has not been tampered with.

Today, we are releasing a proof of concept for SLSA 1 provenance generator ( repo marketplace ). This will allow a user to create and upload provenance alongside their build artifacts, thereby achieving SLSA 1. To use it, add the following snippet to your workflow:Going forward, we plan to work with popular source, build, and packaging platforms to make it as easy as possible to reach higher levels of SLSA. These plans include generating provenance automatically in build systems, propagating provenance natively in package repositories, and adding security features across the major platforms. Our long-term goal is to raise the security bar across the industry so that the default expectation is higher-level SLSA security standards, with minimal effort on the part of software producers."

If Rust is to meet its goals of improving security, stability, and quality Android-wide, we need to be able to use Rust anywhere in the codebase that native code is required. To accomplish this, we need to provide the majority of functionality platform developers use. As we discussed <a href=""https://security.googleblog.com/2021/04/rust-in-android-platform.html"">previously</a>, we have too much C++ to consider ignoring it, rewriting all of it is infeasible, and rewriting older code would likely be counterproductive as the bugs in that code have largely been fixed. This means interoperability is the most practical way forward.</p><p>Before introducing Rust into the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), we needed to demonstrate that Rust interoperability with C and C++ is sufficient for practical, convenient, and safe use within Android. Adding a new language has costs; we needed to demonstrate that Rust would be able to scale across the codebase and meet its potential in order to justify those costs. This post will cover the analysis we did more than a year ago while we evaluated Rust for use in Android. We also present a follow-up analysis with some insights into how the original analysis has held up as Android projects have adopted Rust.  </p><h1>Language interoperability in Android</h1>  <p>Existing language interoperability in Android focuses on well defined foreign-function interface (FFI) boundaries, which is where code written in one programming language calls into code written in a different language. Rust support will likewise focus on the FFI boundary as this is consistent with how AOSP projects are developed, how code is shared, and how dependencies are managed. For Rust interoperability with C, the C application binary interface (ABI) is already sufficient. </p><p>Interoperability with C++ is more challenging and is the focus of this post. While both Rust and C++ support using the C ABI, it is not sufficient for idiomatic usage of either language. Simply enumerating the features of each language results in an unsurprising conclusion: many concepts are not easily translatable, nor do we necessarily want them to be. After all, we’re introducing Rust because many features and characteristics of C++ make it difficult to write safe and correct code. Therefore, our goal is not to consider all language features, but rather to analyze how Android uses C++ and ensure that interop is convenient for the vast majority of our use cases. </p><p>We analyzed code and interfaces in the Android platform specifically, not codebases in general. While this means our specific conclusions may not be accurate for other codebases, we hope the methodology can help others to make a more informed decision about introducing Rust into their large codebase. Our colleagues on the Chrome browser team have done a similar analysis, which you can find <a href=""https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/memory-safety/rust-and-c-interoperability"">here</a>. </p><p>This analysis was not originally intended to be published outside of Google: our goal was to make a data-driven decision on whether or not Rust was a good choice for systems development in Android. While the analysis is intended to be accurate and actionable, it was never intended to be comprehensive, and we’ve pointed out a couple of areas where it could be more complete. However, we also note that initial investigations into these areas showed that they would not significantly impact the results, which is why we decided to not invest the additional effort. </p><h1>Methodology</h1>  <p>Exported functions from Rust and C++ libraries are where we consider interop to be essential. Our goals are simple: </p><ul> <li>Rust must be able to call functions from C++ libraries and vice versa.  </li><li>FFI should require a minimum of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code"">boilerplate</a>.  </li><li>FFI should not require deep expertise. </li></ul><p>While making Rust functions callable from C++ is a goal, this analysis focuses on making C++ functions available to Rust so that new Rust code can be added while taking advantage of existing implementations in C++. To that end, we look at exported C++ functions and consider existing and planned compatibility with Rust via the C ABI and compatibility libraries. Types are extracted by running <code>objdump</code> on shared libraries to find external C++ functions they use<sup id=""fnref1""><a href=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog#fn1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup> and running <code>c++filt</code> to parse the C++ types. This gives functions and their arguments. It does not consider return values, but a preliminary analysis<sup id=""fnref2""><a href=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog#fn2"" rel=""footnote"">2</a></sup> of those revealed that they would not significantly affect the results. </p><p>We then classify each of these types into one of the following buckets: </p><h3 style=""text-align: left;"">Supported by bindgen</h3>  <p>These are generally simple types involving primitives (including pointers and references to them). For these types, Rust’s existing FFI will handle them correctly, and Android’s build system will <a href=""https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:external/selinux/libselinux/Android.bp;l=268;drc=f30e6ff37683d72b65c160a808f87fe356c71c0b"">auto-generate the bindings</a>. </p><h3 style=""text-align: left;"">Supported by cxx compat crate</h3>  <p>These are handled by the <a href=""https://cxx.rs/"">cxx</a> crate. This currently includes <code>std::string</code>, <code>std::vector,</code> and C++ methods (including pointers/references to these types). Users simply have to <a href=""https://cxx.rs/index.html#example"">define</a> the types and functions they want to share across languages and cxx will generate the code to do that safely. </p><h3 style=""text-align: left;"">Native support</h3>  <p>These types are not directly supported, but the interfaces that use them have been manually reworked to add Rust support. Specifically, this includes types used by <a href=""https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/system/tools/aidl/+/1357705"">AIDL</a> and <a href=""https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/build/soong/+/1412889"">protobufs</a>. </p><p>We have also implemented a native interface for <a href=""https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/frameworks/proto_logging/+/1592771"">StatsD</a> as the existing C++ interface relies on method overloading, which is not well supported by bindgen and cxx<sup id=""fnref3""><a href=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog#fn3"" rel=""footnote"">3</a></sup>. Usage of this system does not show up in the analysis because the C++ API does not use any unique types. </p><h3 style=""text-align: left;"">Potential addition to cxx</h3>  <p>This is currently common data structures such as <code><a href=""https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx/issues/87"">std::optional</a></code> and <code>std::chrono::duration</code> and custom string and vector implementations.  </p><p>These can either be supported natively by a future contribution to cxx, or by using its ExternType facilities. We have only included types in this category that we believe are relatively straightforward to implement and have a reasonable chance of being accepted into the cxx project. </p><h3 style=""text-align: left;"">We don't need/intend to support</h3>  <p>Some types are exposed in today’s C++ APIs that are either an implicit part of the API, not an API we expect to want to use from Rust, or are language specific. Examples of types we do not intend to support include: </p><ul> <li>Mutexes - we expect that locking will take place in one language or the other, rather than needing to pass mutexes between languages, as per our coarse-grained philosophy.  </li><li><code>native_handle</code> - this is a JNI interface type, so it is inappropriate for use in Rust/C++ communication.  </li><li><code>std::locale&amp;</code> - Android uses a separate locale system from C++ locales. This type primarily appears in output due to e.g., <code>cout</code> usage, which would be inappropriate to use in Rust. </li></ul><p>Overall, this category represents types that we do not believe a Rust developer should be using.  </p><h3 style=""text-align: left;"">HIDL</h3>  <p>Android is in the process of deprecating <a href=""https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/hidl"">HIDL</a> and migrating to <a href=""https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/aidl/aidl-hals"">AIDL for HALs</a> for new services.We’re also migrating some existing implementations to stable AIDL. Our current plan is to not support HIDL, preferring to migrate to stable AIDL instead. These types thus currently fall into the “We don't need/intend to support'' bucket above, but we break them out to be more specific. If there is sufficient demand for HIDL support, we may revisit this decision later. </p><h3 style=""text-align: left;"">Other</h3>  <p>This contains all types that do not fit into any of the above buckets. It is currently mostly <code>std::string</code> being passed by value, which is not supported by cxx. </p><h1>Top C++ libraries</h1>  <p>One of the primary reasons for supporting interop is to allow reuse of existing code. With this in mind, we determined the most commonly used C++ libraries in Android: <code>liblog</code>, <code>libbase</code>, <code>libutils</code>, <code>libcutils</code>, <code>libhidlbase</code>, <code>libbinder</code>, <code>libhardware</code>, <code>libz</code>, <code>libcrypto</code>, and <code>libui</code>. We then analyzed all of the external C++ functions used by these libraries and their arguments to determine how well they would interoperate with Rust. </p><div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><span style=""border: none; display: inline-block; height: 385px; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em; overflow: hidden; width: 624px;""><img src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/e9sdO_K8c9Fw3Eb_andiYj1ETUe-7crTyY9Tc-JU6CwcTZvHIeyRNi7zH6X1QXhHwBKLiS6h795GhKMvZV-PgyNO3Cmuo9AHKlt8TdUTIXVPkXg_PfTnbTrVeLx3t-AeRbFW4KLIrg=s16000"" style=""margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"" title=""Chart"" /></span></div><p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-9ae294c5-7fff-89e6-a96f-1b9484a565e2""><span face=""Roboto, sans-serif"" style=""font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""></span></span></p><p>Overall, 81% of types are in the first three categories (which we currently fully support) and 87% are in the first four categories (which includes those we believe we can easily support).

Additionally, their modularity presents an opportunity for interop support. </p><p>We analyzed 64 binaries and libraries in 21 modules.

Using cxx allows the Bluetooth team to more easily serve legacy protocols like HIDL until they are phased out by using the existing C++ support to incrementally migrate their service.  </li><li><a href=""https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:system/security/keystore2/src/service.rs;l=343;drc=3ed5da79ae8698ded3684577b6b5094d9d596399"">AIDL in keystore</a> - Keystore implements AIDL services and interacts with apps and other services over AIDL.

Profcollectd is a small daemon that only exists on non-production engineering builds. Instead of using cxx it uses some small manually-written C wrappers around C++ libraries that it then passes to bindgen. </li></ul><h1>Conclusion</h1>  <p>Bindgen and cxx provide the vast majority of Rust/C++ interoperability needed by Android. For some of the exceptions, such as AIDL, the native version provides convenient interop between Rust and other languages. Manually written wrappers can be used to handle the few remaining types and functions not supported by other options as well as to create ergonomic Rust APIs. Overall, we believe interoperability between Rust and C++ is already largely sufficient for convenient use of Rust within Android. </p><p>If you are considering how Rust could integrate into your C++ project, we recommend doing a similar analysis of your codebase. When addressing interop gaps, we recommend that you consider upstreaming support to existing compat libraries like cxx. </p><h1>Acknowledgements</h1>  <p>Our first attempt at quantifying Rust/C++ interop involved analyzing the potential mismatches between the languages. This led to a lot of interesting information, but was difficult to draw actionable conclusions from. Rather than enumerating all the potential places where interop could occur, Stephen Hines suggested that we instead consider how code is currently shared between C/C++ projects as a reasonable proxy for where we’ll also likely want interop for Rust. This provided us with actionable information that was straightforward to prioritize and implement.

If Rust is to meet its goals of improving security, stability, and quality Android-wide, we need to be able to use Rust anywhere in the codebase that native code is required. To accomplish this, we need to provide the majority of functionality platform developers use. As we discussed previously, we have too much C++ to consider ignoring it, rewriting all of it is infeasible, and rewriting older code would likely be counterproductive as the bugs in that code have largely been fixed. This means interoperability is the most practical way forward.

Before introducing Rust into the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), we needed to demonstrate that Rust interoperability with C and C++ is sufficient for practical, convenient, and safe use within Android. Adding a new language has costs; we needed to demonstrate that Rust would be able to scale across the codebase and meet its potential in order to justify those costs. This post will cover the analysis we did more than a year ago while we evaluated Rust for use in Android. We also present a follow-up analysis with some insights into how the original analysis has held up as Android projects have adopted Rust.

Language interoperability in Android

Existing language interoperability in Android focuses on well defined foreign-function interface (FFI) boundaries, which is where code written in one programming language calls into code written in a different language. Rust support will likewise focus on the FFI boundary as this is consistent with how AOSP projects are developed, how code is shared, and how dependencies are managed. For Rust interoperability with C, the C application binary interface (ABI) is already sufficient.

Interoperability with C++ is more challenging and is the focus of this post. While both Rust and C++ support using the C ABI, it is not sufficient for idiomatic usage of either language. Simply enumerating the features of each language results in an unsurprising conclusion: many concepts are not easily translatable, nor do we necessarily want them to be. After all, we’re introducing Rust because many features and characteristics of C++ make it difficult to write safe and correct code. Therefore, our goal is not to consider all language features, but rather to analyze how Android uses C++ and ensure that interop is convenient for the vast majority of our use cases.

We analyzed code and interfaces in the Android platform specifically, not codebases in general. While this means our specific conclusions may not be accurate for other codebases, we hope the methodology can help others to make a more informed decision about introducing Rust into their large codebase. Our colleagues on the Chrome browser team have done a similar analysis, which you can find here.

This analysis was not originally intended to be published outside of Google: our goal was to make a data-driven decision on whether or not Rust was a good choice for systems development in Android. While the analysis is intended to be accurate and actionable, it was never intended to be comprehensive, and we’ve pointed out a couple of areas where it could be more complete. However, we also note that initial investigations into these areas showed that they would not significantly impact the results, which is why we decided to not invest the additional effort.

Methodology

Exported functions from Rust and C++ libraries are where we consider interop to be essential. Our goals are simple:

Rust must be able to call functions from C++ libraries and vice versa.

FFI should require a minimum of boilerplate.

FFI should not require deep expertise.

While making Rust functions callable from C++ is a goal, this analysis focuses on making C++ functions available to Rust so that new Rust code can be added while taking advantage of existing implementations in C++. To that end, we look at exported C++ functions and consider existing and planned compatibility with Rust via the C ABI and compatibility libraries. Types are extracted by running objdump on shared libraries to find external C++ functions they use1 and running c++filt to parse the C++ types. This gives functions and their arguments. It does not consider return values, but a preliminary analysis2 of those revealed that they would not significantly affect the results.

We then classify each of these types into one of the following buckets:

Supported by bindgen

These are generally simple types involving primitives (including pointers and references to them). For these types, Rust’s existing FFI will handle them correctly, and Android’s build system will auto-generate the bindings.

Supported by cxx compat crate

These are handled by the cxx crate. This currently includes std::string , std::vector, and C++ methods (including pointers/references to these types). Users simply have to define the types and functions they want to share across languages and cxx will generate the code to do that safely.

Native support

These types are not directly supported, but the interfaces that use them have been manually reworked to add Rust support. Specifically, this includes types used by AIDL and protobufs.

We have also implemented a native interface for StatsD as the existing C++ interface relies on method overloading, which is not well supported by bindgen and cxx3. Usage of this system does not show up in the analysis because the C++ API does not use any unique types.

Potential addition to cxx

This is currently common data structures such as std::optional and std::chrono::duration and custom string and vector implementations.

These can either be supported natively by a future contribution to cxx, or by using its ExternType facilities. We have only included types in this category that we believe are relatively straightforward to implement and have a reasonable chance of being accepted into the cxx project.

We don't need/intend to support

Some types are exposed in today’s C++ APIs that are either an implicit part of the API, not an API we expect to want to use from Rust, or are language specific. Examples of types we do not intend to support include:

Mutexes - we expect that locking will take place in one language or the other, rather than needing to pass mutexes between languages, as per our coarse-grained philosophy.

native_handle - this is a JNI interface type, so it is inappropriate for use in Rust/C++ communication.

- this is a JNI interface type, so it is inappropriate for use in Rust/C++ communication. std::locale& - Android uses a separate locale system from C++ locales. This type primarily appears in output due to e.g., cout usage, which would be inappropriate to use in Rust.

Overall, this category represents types that we do not believe a Rust developer should be using.

HIDL

Android is in the process of deprecating HIDL and migrating to AIDL for HALs for new services.We’re also migrating some existing implementations to stable AIDL. Our current plan is to not support HIDL, preferring to migrate to stable AIDL instead. These types thus currently fall into the “We don't need/intend to support'' bucket above, but we break them out to be more specific. If there is sufficient demand for HIDL support, we may revisit this decision later.

Other

This contains all types that do not fit into any of the above buckets. It is currently mostly std::string being passed by value, which is not supported by cxx.

Top C++ libraries

One of the primary reasons for supporting interop is to allow reuse of existing code. With this in mind, we determined the most commonly used C++ libraries in Android: liblog , libbase , libutils , libcutils , libhidlbase , libbinder , libhardware , libz , libcrypto , and libui . We then analyzed all of the external C++ functions used by these libraries and their arguments to determine how well they would interoperate with Rust.

Overall, 81% of types are in the first three categories (which we currently fully support) and 87% are in the first four categories (which includes those we believe we can easily support). Almost all of the remaining types are those we believe we do not need to support.

Mainline modules

In addition to analyzing popular C++ libraries, we also examined Mainline modules. Supporting this context is critical as Android is migrating some of its core functionality to Mainline, including much of the native code we hope to augment with Rust. Additionally, their modularity presents an opportunity for interop support.

We analyzed 64 binaries and libraries in 21 modules. For each analyzed library we examined their used C++ functions and analyzed the types of their arguments to determine how well they would interoperate with Rust in the same way we did above for the top 10 libraries.

Here 88% of types are in the first three categories and 90% in the first four, with almost all of the remaining being types we do not need to handle.

Analysis of Rust/C++ Interop in AOSP

With almost a year of Rust development in AOSP behind us, and more than a hundred thousand lines of code written in Rust, we can now examine how our original analysis has held up based on how C/C++ code is currently called from Rust in AOSP.4

The results largely match what we expected from our analysis with bindgen handling the majority of interop needs. Extensive use of AIDL by the new Keystore2 service results in the primary difference between our original analysis and actual Rust usage in the “Native Support” category.

A few current examples of interop are:

Cxx in Bluetooth - While Rust is intended to be the primary language for Bluetooth, migrating from the existing C/C++ implementation will happen in stages. Using cxx allows the Bluetooth team to more easily serve legacy protocols like HIDL until they are phased out by using the existing C++ support to incrementally migrate their service.

AIDL in keystore - Keystore implements AIDL services and interacts with apps and other services over AIDL. Providing this functionality would be difficult to support with tools like cxx or bindgen, but the native AIDL support is simple and ergonomic to use.

Manually-written wrappers in profcollectd - While our goal is to provide seamless interop for most use cases, we also want to demonstrate that, even when auto-generated interop solutions are not an option, manually creating them can be simple and straightforward. Profcollectd is a small daemon that only exists on non-production engineering builds. Instead of using cxx it uses some small manually-written C wrappers around C++ libraries that it then passes to bindgen.

Conclusion

Bindgen and cxx provide the vast majority of Rust/C++ interoperability needed by Android. For some of the exceptions, such as AIDL, the native version provides convenient interop between Rust and other languages. Manually written wrappers can be used to handle the few remaining types and functions not supported by other options as well as to create ergonomic Rust APIs. Overall, we believe interoperability between Rust and C++ is already largely sufficient for convenient use of Rust within Android.

If you are considering how Rust could integrate into your C++ project, we recommend doing a similar analysis of your codebase. When addressing interop gaps, we recommend that you consider upstreaming support to existing compat libraries like cxx.

Acknowledgements

Our first attempt at quantifying Rust/C++ interop involved analyzing the potential mismatches between the languages. This led to a lot of interesting information, but was difficult to draw actionable conclusions from. Rather than enumerating all the potential places where interop could occur, Stephen Hines suggested that we instead consider how code is currently shared between C/C++ projects as a reasonable proxy for where we’ll also likely want interop for Rust. This provided us with actionable information that was straightforward to prioritize and implement. Looking back, the data from our real-world Rust usage has reinforced that the initial methodology was sound. Thanks Stephen!

Whether you're trying to prevent these attacks, responding to an ongoing one or recovering from one, you understand that knowing what is happening in your CI/CD pipeline is critical. <br /><br />Fortunately, the Kubernetes-native <a href=""http://tekton.dev/"">Tekton</a> project –  an open-source framework for creating CI/CD systems – was designed with security in mind from Day One, and the new <a href=""https://github.com/tektoncd/chains"">Tekton Chains</a> project is here to help take it to the next level. Tekton Chains securely captures metadata for CI/CD pipeline executions. We made two really important design decisions early on in Tekton that make supply chain security easy: declarative pipeline definitions and explicit state transitions. This next section will explain what these mean in practice and how they make it easy to build a secure delivery pipeline.<div><br /><div><b><br /></b></div><div><b>Definitions or “boxes and arrows”</b><br />Just like everything in your high school physics class, a CI/CD pipeline can be modeled as a series of boxes. Each box has some inputs, some outputs, and some steps that happen in the middle. Even if you have one big complicated bash script that fetches dependencies, builds programs, runs tests, downloads the internet and deploys to production, you can draw boxes and arrows to represent this flow. The boxes might be really big, but you can do it.<br /><br />Since the initial whiteboard sketches, the <a href=""https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/pipelines.md"">Pipeline</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/tasks.md"">Task</a> CRDs in Tekton were designed to allow users to define each step of their pipeline at a granular level. These types include support for mandatory declared inputs, outputs, and build environments. This means you can track exactly what sources went into a build, what tools were used during the build itself and what artifacts came out at the end. By breaking up a large monolithic pipeline into a series of smaller, reusable steps, you can increase visibility into the overall system. This makes it easier to understand your exposure to supply chain attacks, detect issues when they do happen and recover from them after.</div><div><b><br /></b></div><div><b><br /></b></div><div><b>Explicit transitions</b><br />After a pipeline is defined, there are a few approaches to orchestrating it: level-triggered and edge-triggered. Like most of the Kubernetes ecosystem, Tekton is designed to operate in a level-triggered fashion. This means steps are executed explicitly by a central orchestrator which runs one task, waits for completion, then decides what to do next. In edge-based systems, a pipeline definition would be translated into a set of events and listeners. Each step fires off events when it completes, and these events are then picked up by listeners which run the next set of steps.<br /><br />Event-based or edge-triggered systems are easy to reason about, but can be tricky to manage at scale. They also make it much harder to track an artifact as it flows through the entire system. Each step in the pipeline only knows about the one immediately before it; no step is responsible for tracking the entire execution. This can become problematic when you try to understand the security posture of your delivery pipeline.<br /><br />Tekton was designed with the opposite approach in mind - level-triggered. Instead of a Rube-Goldberg machine tied together with duct tape and clothespins, Tekton is more like an explicit assembly-line. Level-triggered systems like Tekton move from state-to-state in a calculated manner by a central orchestrator. They require more explicit-design up front, but they are easier to observe and reason about after. Supply chains that use systems like Tekton are more secure.</div><div><b><br /></b></div><div><b><br /></b></div><div><b>Secure delivery pipeline through chains and provenance</b><br />So how do these two design decisions combine to make supply chain security easier? Enter Tekton Chains.<br /><br />By observing the execution of a Task or a Pipeline and paying careful attention to the inputs, outputs, and steps along the way, we can make it easier to track down what happened and why later on. This ""observer"" can be run in a separate trust domain and cryptographically sign all of this captured metadata as it's stored, leaving a tamper-proof activity ledger. This technique is called ""<a href=""https://cloud.google.com/security/binary-authorization-for-borg"">verifiable builds</a>."" This securely generated metadata can be used in a number of ways, from audit logging to recovering from security breaches to pre-deployment policy enforcement. <br /><br />You can install Chains into any Tekton-enabled cluster and configure it to generate this cryptographically-signed supply chain metadata for your builds. Chains supports pluggable signature systems like PGP, x509 and Cloud KMS's. Payloads can be generated in a few different industry-standard formats like the RedHat Simple-Signing and the In-Toto Provenance specifications.

If you want to play around with it now, hermekton can be run as an <a href=""https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/main/docs/hermetic.md"">alpha feature</a> in experimental mode. When hermekton is enabled, a build runs in a locked-down environment without network connectivity. Hermetic builds guarantee all inputs have been explicitly declared ahead-of-time, providing for a more auditable supply-chain. Hermetic builds and Chains align well, because the hermeticity build property is contained in the full build provenance captured by Chains. Chains can generate and attest to metadata specifying exactly which sections of a build had network access. <br /><br />This means policy can be defined around exactly which build tools are allowed to access the network and which ones are not. This metadata can be used in policies at build time (banning compilers with security vulnerabilities) or stored and used by policy engines at deploy time (only code-reviewed and verifiably built containers are allowed to run).<br /><br />We believe supply-chain security must be built-in and by default. No task orchestrator can promise perfect supply-chain security, but TektonCD was designed with unique features in mind that make it easier to do the right thing. We're always looking for feedback on the design, goals and requirements.

Definitions or “boxes and arrows”

Just like everything in your high school physics class, a CI/CD pipeline can be modeled as a series of boxes. Each box has some inputs, some outputs, and some steps that happen in the middle. Even if you have one big complicated bash script that fetches dependencies, builds programs, runs tests, downloads the internet and deploys to production, you can draw boxes and arrows to represent this flow. The boxes might be really big, but you can do it.



Since the initial whiteboard sketches, the Just like everything in your high school physics class, a CI/CD pipeline can be modeled as a series of boxes. Each box has some inputs, some outputs, and some steps that happen in the middle. Even if you have one big complicated bash script that fetches dependencies, builds programs, runs tests, downloads the internet and deploys to production, you can draw boxes and arrows to represent this flow. The boxes might be really big, but you can do it.Since the initial whiteboard sketches, the Pipeline and Task CRDs in Tekton were designed to allow users to define each step of their pipeline at a granular level. These types include support for mandatory declared inputs, outputs, and build environments. This means you can track exactly what sources went into a build, what tools were used during the build itself and what artifacts came out at the end. By breaking up a large monolithic pipeline into a series of smaller, reusable steps, you can increase visibility into the overall system. This makes it easier to understand your exposure to supply chain attacks, detect issues when they do happen and recover from them after.









Explicit transitions

After a pipeline is defined, there are a few approaches to orchestrating it: level-triggered and edge-triggered. Like most of the Kubernetes ecosystem, Tekton is designed to operate in a level-triggered fashion. This means steps are executed explicitly by a central orchestrator which runs one task, waits for completion, then decides what to do next. In edge-based systems, a pipeline definition would be translated into a set of events and listeners. Each step fires off events when it completes, and these events are then picked up by listeners which run the next set of steps.



Event-based or edge-triggered systems are easy to reason about, but can be tricky to manage at scale. They also make it much harder to track an artifact as it flows through the entire system. Each step in the pipeline only knows about the one immediately before it; no step is responsible for tracking the entire execution. This can become problematic when you try to understand the security posture of your delivery pipeline.



Tekton was designed with the opposite approach in mind - level-triggered. Instead of a Rube-Goldberg machine tied together with duct tape and clothespins, Tekton is more like an explicit assembly-line. Level-triggered systems like Tekton move from state-to-state in a calculated manner by a central orchestrator. They require more explicit-design up front, but they are easier to observe and reason about after. Supply chains that use systems like Tekton are more secure.









Secure delivery pipeline through chains and provenance

So how do these two design decisions combine to make supply chain security easier? Enter Tekton Chains.



By observing the execution of a Task or a Pipeline and paying careful attention to the inputs, outputs, and steps along the way, we can make it easier to track down what happened and why later on. This ""observer"" can be run in a separate trust domain and cryptographically sign all of this captured metadata as it's stored, leaving a tamper-proof activity ledger. This technique is called ""



You can install Chains into any Tekton-enabled cluster and configure it to generate this cryptographically-signed supply chain metadata for your builds. Chains supports pluggable signature systems like PGP, x509 and Cloud KMS's. Payloads can be generated in a few different industry-standard formats like the RedHat Simple-Signing and the In-Toto Provenance specifications.

Improved download protection

Enhanced Safe Browsing will now offer you even better protection against risky files.

When you download a file, Chrome performs a first level check with Google Safe Browsing using metadata about the downloaded file, such as the digest of the contents and the source of the file, to determine whether it’s potentially suspicious. For any downloads that Safe Browsing deems risky, but not clearly unsafe, Enhanced Safe Browsing users will be presented with a warning and the ability to send the file to be scanned for a more in depth analysis (pictured above).

If you choose to send the file, Chrome will upload it to Google Safe Browsing, which will scan it using its static and dynamic analysis classifiers in real time. After a short wait, if Safe Browsing determines the file is unsafe, Chrome will display a warning. As always, you can bypass the warning and open the file without scanning.

Much like speculative execution vulnerabilities in CPUs, Rowhammer is a breach of the security guarantees made by the underlying hardware. As an electrical coupling phenomenon within the silicon itself, Rowhammer allows the potential bypass of hardware and software memory protection policies. This can allow untrusted code to break out of its sandbox and take full control of the system.<br /><br />Rowhammer was first discussed in a <a href=""https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~yoonguk/papers/kim-isca14.pdf"">paper</a> in 2014 for what was then the mainstream generation of DRAM: DDR3. The following year, Google’s Project Zero released a working privilege-escalation <a href=""https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2015/03/exploiting-dram-rowhammer-bug-to-gain.html"">exploit</a>. In response, DRAM manufacturers implemented proprietary logic inside their chips that attempted to track frequently accessed addresses and reactively mitigate when necessary.<br /><br />As DDR4 became widely adopted, it appeared as though Rowhammer had faded away thanks in part to these built-in defense mechanisms. However, in 2020, the <a href=""https://www.vusec.net/projects/trrespass/"">TRRespass</a> paper showed how to reverse-engineer and neutralize the defense by distributing accesses, demonstrating that Rowhammer techniques are still viable. Earlier this year, the <a href=""https://www.vusec.net/projects/smash/"">SMASH</a> research went one step further and demonstrated exploitation from JavaScript, without invoking cache-management primitives or system calls.<br /><br />Traditionally, Rowhammer was understood to operate at a distance of one row: when a DRAM row is accessed repeatedly (the “aggressor”), bit flips were found only in the two adjacent rows (the “victims”). However, with Half-Double, we have observed Rowhammer effects propagating to rows beyond adjacent neighbors, albeit at a reduced strength. Given three consecutive rows A, B, and C, we were able to attack C by directing a very large number of accesses to A, along with just a handful (~dozens) to B. Based on our experiments, accesses to B have a non-linear gating effect, in which they appear to “transport” the Rowhammer effect of A onto C. Unlike TRRespass, which exploits the blind spots of manufacturer-dependent defenses, Half-Double is an intrinsic property of the underlying silicon substrate. This is likely an indication that the electrical coupling responsible for Rowhammer is a property of distance, effectively becoming stronger and longer-ranged as cell geometries shrink down. Distances greater than two are conceivable.<div><br /><img src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/tGDqIvEueBY6NLESevtjLzZdUMkkCJbuhfEc0zTVHFriANpGG0zzdXwooPRwjqrwvuB9x-MpcsunqbIo1E1BXBaQwiLY5c1L2ueBP3jpMm8djj00U8d2q3MzdiSDEWzK7Ryrjhz2kQ"" /><br /><br /><br /></div><div>Google has been working with <a href=""https://www.jedec.org/"">JEDEC</a>, an independent semiconductor engineering trade organization, along with other industry partners, in search of possible solutions for the Rowhammer phenomenon.

As with any large project, introducing a new language requires careful consideration. For Android, one important area was assessing how to best fit Rust into Android’s build system. Currently this means the <a href=""https://source.android.com/setup/build"">Soong</a> build system (where the Rust support resides), but these design decisions and considerations are equally applicable for <a href=""https://blog.bazel.build/2020/11/12/aosp_migrating_to_bazel.html"">Bazel</a> when AOSP migrates to that build system. This post discusses some of the key design considerations and resulting decisions we made in integrating Rust support into Android’s build system. </p><h2>Rust integration into large projects</h2>  <p>A RustConf 2019 meeting on <a href=""https://users.rust-lang.org/t/rust-in-large-organizations-meeting/32059"">Rust usage within large organizations</a> highlighted several challenges, such as the risk that eschewing Cargo in favor of using the Rust Compiler, <code>rustc, </code> directly (see next section) may remove organizations from the wider Rust community. We share this same concern. When changes to imported third-party crates might be beneficial to the wider community, our goal is to upstream those changes. Likewise when crates developed for Android could benefit the wider Rust community, we hope to release them as independent crates. We believe that the success of Rust within Android is dependent on minimizing any divergence between Android and the Rust community at large, and hope that the Rust community will benefit from Android’s involvement. </p><h2>No nested build systems</h2>  <p>Rust provides Cargo as the default <a href=""https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-03-hello-cargo.html"">build system and package manager</a>, collecting dependencies and invoking <code>rustc</code> (the Rust compiler) to build the target crate (Rust package). <a href=""https://android.googlesource.com/platform/build/soong/+/refs/heads/master/README.md"">Soong</a> takes this role instead in Android and calls <code>rustc</code> directly for several reasons: </p><ul> <li>In Cargo, C dependencies are handled independently in an ad-hoc manner via build.rs scripts. Soong already provides a mechanism for building C libraries and defining them as dependencies, and Android carefully controls the compiler version and global compilation flags to ensure libraries are built a particular way. Relying on Cargo would introduce a second non-Soong mechanism for defining/building C libraries that would not be constrained by the carefully selected compilation controls implemented in Soong. This could also lead to multiple different versions of the same library, negatively impacting memory/disk usage.   <li>Calling compilers directly through Soong provides the stability and control Android requires for the variety of build configurations it supports (for example, specifying where target-specific dependencies are and which compilation flags to use). While it would technically be possible to achieve the necessary level of control over <code>rustc</code> indirectly through Cargo, Soong would have no understanding of how the <code>Cargo.toml</code> (the Cargo build file) would influence the commands Cargo emits to <code>rustc</code>. Paired with the fact that Cargo evolves independently, this would severely restrict Soong’s ability to precisely control how build artifacts are created.   <li>Builds which are self-contained and insensitive to the host configuration, known as <strong>hermetic builds</strong>, are necessary for Android to produce reproducible builds. Cargo, which relies on <strong><code>build.rs</code></strong> scripts, doesn’t yet provide hermeticity guarantees.  <li>Incremental builds are important to maintain engineering productivity; building Android takes a considerable amount of resources. Cargo was not designed for integration into existing build systems and does not expose its compilation units. Each Cargo invocation builds <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-roadmap-2017/issues/12#issuecomment-278118819"">the entire crate dependency graph</a> for a given <code>Cargo.toml</code>, rebuilding crates multiple times across projects<sup id=""fnref1""><a href=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog#fn1"" rel=""footnote"">1</a></sup>. This is too coarse for integration into Soong’s incremental build support, which expects smaller compilation units. This support is necessary to scale up Rust usage within Android. <p>Using the Rust compiler directly allows us to avoid these issues and is consistent with how we compile all other code in AOSP. It provides the most control over the build process and eases integration into Android’s existing build system. Unfortunately, avoiding it introduces several challenges and influences many other build system decisions because Cargo usage is so deeply ingrained in the Rust crate ecosystem.  </p><h2>No build.rs scripts</h2>  <p>A<code> build.rs </code>script compiles to a Rust binary which Cargo builds and executes during a build to handle pre-build tasks, commonly setting up the build environment, or building libraries in other languages (for example C/C++). This is analogous to configure scripts used for other languages.  </p><p>Avoiding <code>build.rs</code> scripts somewhat flows naturally from not relying on Cargo since supporting these would require replicating Cargo behavior and assumptions. Beyond this however, there are good reasons for AOSP to avoid build scripts as well: </p><ul> <li><code>build.rs</code> scripts can execute arbitrary code on the build host. From a security perspective, this introduces an additional burden when adding or updating third-party code as the <code>build.rs</code> script needs careful scrutiny.  <li>Third-party <code>build.rs</code> scripts may not be hermetic or reproducible in <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9273#issuecomment-800765010"">potentially subtle ways</a>. It is also common for <code>build.rs</code> files to access files outside the build directory (such as <code>/usr/lib</code>). When they are not hermetic, we would need to either carry a local patch or work with upstream to resolve the issue.  <li>The most common task for <code>build.rs</code> is to build C libraries which Rust code depends on. We already support this through Soong.  <li>Android likewise avoids running build scripts while building for other languages, instead, simply using them to inform the structure of the <code>Android.bp</code> file. </li></ul></li></ul><p>For instances in third-party code where a build script is used only to compile C dependencies, we either use existing <code>cc_library</code> Soong definitions (such as <a href=""https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:external/boringssl/Android.bp;drc=859a48db620ed6a63b786182d1bb55f04d1f124c;l=312"">boringssl</a> for <a href=""https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:external/rust/crates/quiche/Android.bp;drc=1b19aa5ba6b71372df6ec176d15993631552c2eb;l=65"">quiche</a>) or <a href=""https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:external/rust/crates/grpcio-sys/Android.bp;drc=bb4f797895a614ac15d1ea90a62660900a6a6b30;l=68"">create new definitions</a> for crate-specific code.  </p><p>When the <a href=""https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:external/rust/crates/libsqlite3-sys/build.rs;l=379;drc=cc6e6357c57e09c4078b3c54cac455111dd3e221"">build.rs is used to generate source</a>, we try to replicate <a href=""https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:external/rust/crates/libsqlite3-sys/android/build.rs;drc=ae93c4c77b203617f6fdf5e5e6a0e1fee02caa91"">the core functionality</a> in a Soong <a href=""https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:external/rust/crates/libsqlite3-sys/android/Android.bp;drc=0f6dcf73b798c60a4ff204cc4b1a98572fec3393"">rust_binary</a> module for use as a <a href=""https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:external/rust/crates/libsqlite3-sys/Android.bp;drc=0f6dcf73b798c60a4ff204cc4b1a98572fec3393;l=132"">custom source generator</a>. In other cases where Soong can provide the information without source generation, we may carry a <a href=""https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:external/rust/crates/rustversion/patches/version.diff;drc=d550abe65fea6425374f69306f0a4e74585b238c"">small patch</a> that leverages this information. </p><h3>Why proc_macro but not build.rs?</h3>  <p>Why do we support <code>proc_macros</code>, which are compiler plug-ins that execute code on the host within the compiler context, but not <code>build.rs</code> scripts? </p><p>While <code>build.rs</code> code is written as one-off code to handle building a single crate, <code>proc_macros </code>define reusable functionality within the compiler which can become widely relied upon across the Rust community. As a result popular <code>proc_macros</code> are generally better maintained and more scrutinized upstream, which makes the code review process more manageable. They are also more readily sandboxed as part of the build process since they are less likely to have dependencies external to the compiler. </p><p><code>proc_macros</code> are also a language feature rather than a method for building code. These are relied upon by source code, are unavoidable for third-party dependencies, and are useful enough to define and use within our platform code. While we can avoid build.rs by leveraging our build system, the same can’t be said of proc_macros. </p><p>There is also precedence for compiler plugin support within the Android build system. For example see Soong’s <a href=""https://ci.android.com/builds/submitted/7271141/linux/latest/raw/java.html#java_plugin"">java_plugin</a> modules. </p><h2>Generated source as crates</h2>  <p>Unlike C/C++ compilers, <code>rustc</code> only accepts a single source file representing an entry point to a binary or library. It expects that the source tree is structured such that all required source files can be automatically discovered. This means that generated source either needs to be placed in the source tree or provided through an include directive in source: </p>   <pre class=""prettyprint"">include!(""/path/to/hello.rs"");</pre>  <p>The Rust community depends on <code>build.rs</code> scripts alongside assumptions about the Cargo build environment to <a href=""https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-script-examples.html#code-generation"">get around this limitation</a>. When building, the <code>cargo</code> command sets an <a href=""https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html#environment-variables-cargo-sets-for-crates"">OUT_DIR environment variable</a> which build.rs scripts are expected to place generated source code in. This source can then be included via: </p>   <pre class=""prettyprint"">include!(concat!(env!(""OUT_DIR""), ""/hello.rs""));</pre>  <p>This presents a challenge for Soong as outputs for each module are placed in their own <code>out/</code> directory<sup id=""fnref2""><a href=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog#fn2"" rel=""footnote"">2</a></sup>; there is no single <code>OUT_DIR</code> where dependencies output their generated source. </p><p>For platform code, we prefer to package generated source into a crate that can be imported. There are a few reasons to favor this approach: </p><ul> <li>Prevent generated source file names from colliding.  <li>Reduce <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen/blob/master/book/src/tutorial-4.md"">boilerplate code</a> checked-in throughout the tree and which needs to be maintained. Any boilerplate necessary to make the <a href=""https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:build/soong/rust/protobuf.go;drc=6eff900b67a0ed7e639ae304b1d453b620e9b79d;l=174"">generated source compile</a> into a crate can be centrally maintained.  <li>Avoid implicit<sup id=""fnref3""><a href=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog#fn3"" rel=""footnote"">3</a></sup> interactions between generated code and the surrounding crate.    <li>Reduce pressure on memory and disk by dynamically liking commonly used generated sources. <p>As a result, all of Android’s Rust source generation module types produce code that can be compiled and used <a href=""https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:system/bt/gd/rust/facade/Android.bp;drc=92fa0f9ac23d547cfa62ddbf9e92e7755e1b1df6;l=19"">as a crate</a>. </p><p>We still support third-party crates without modification by copying all the generated source dependencies for a module into a single per-module directory similar to Cargo. Soong then sets the <code>OUT_DIR</code> environment variable to that directory when compiling the module so the generated source can be found. However we discourage use of this mechanism in platform code unless absolutely necessary for the reasons described above. </p><h2>Dynamic linkage by default</h2>  <p>By default, the Rust ecosystem assumes that crates will be <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/10209"">statically linked into binaries</a>. The usual benefits of dynamic libraries are upgrades (whether for security or functionality) and decreased memory usage. Rust’s lack of a stable binary interface and usage of cross-crate information flow prevents upgrading libraries without upgrading all dependent code. Even when the same crate is used by two different programs on the system, it is unlikely to be provided by the same shared object<sup id=""fnref4""><a href=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog#fn4"" rel=""footnote"">4</a></sup> due to the precision with which Rust identifies its crates. This makes Rust binaries more portable but also results in larger disk and memory footprints. </p><p>This is problematic for Android devices where resources like memory and disk usage must be carefully managed because statically linking all crates into Rust binaries would result in excessive code duplication (especially in the standard library). However, our situation is also different from the standard host environment: we build Android using global decisions about dependencies. This means that nearly every crate is shareable between all users of that crate. Thus, we opt to link crates dynamically by default for device targets. This reduces the overall memory footprint of Rust in Android by allowing crates to be reused across multiple binaries which depend on them. </p><p>Since this is unusual in the Rust community, not all third-party crates support dynamic compilation. Sometimes we must carry <a href=""https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:external/rust/crates/untrusted/patches/std.diff;drc=e595b63c7542df5941c7701feaf9b1e82919e80e"">small patches</a> while we <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/81469"">work with</a> <a href=""https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ajgalenson"">upstream maintainers</a> to add support. </p><h2>Current Status of Build Support</h2>  <p>We support building all output types supported by <code>rustc</code> (<code>rlib</code>s, <code>dylib</code>s, <code>proc_macro</code>s, <code>cdylib</code>s, <code>staticlib</code>s, and executables).

As with any large project, introducing a new language requires careful consideration. For Android, one important area was assessing how to best fit Rust into Android’s build system. Currently this means the Soong build system (where the Rust support resides), but these design decisions and considerations are equally applicable for Bazel when AOSP migrates to that build system. This post discusses some of the key design considerations and resulting decisions we made in integrating Rust support into Android’s build system.

Rust integration into large projects

A RustConf 2019 meeting on Rust usage within large organizations highlighted several challenges, such as the risk that eschewing Cargo in favor of using the Rust Compiler, rustc, directly (see next section) may remove organizations from the wider Rust community. We share this same concern. When changes to imported third-party crates might be beneficial to the wider community, our goal is to upstream those changes. Likewise when crates developed for Android could benefit the wider Rust community, we hope to release them as independent crates. We believe that the success of Rust within Android is dependent on minimizing any divergence between Android and the Rust community at large, and hope that the Rust community will benefit from Android’s involvement.

No nested build systems

Rust provides Cargo as the default build system and package manager, collecting dependencies and invoking rustc (the Rust compiler) to build the target crate (Rust package). Soong takes this role instead in Android and calls rustc directly for several reasons:

In Cargo, C dependencies are handled independently in an ad-hoc manner via build.rs scripts. Soong already provides a mechanism for building C libraries and defining them as dependencies, and Android carefully controls the compiler version and global compilation flags to ensure libraries are built a particular way. Relying on Cargo would introduce a second non-Soong mechanism for defining/building C libraries that would not be constrained by the carefully selected compilation controls implemented in Soong. This could also lead to multiple different versions of the same library, negatively impacting memory/disk usage.

Calling compilers directly through Soong provides the stability and control Android requires for the variety of build configurations it supports (for example, specifying where target-specific dependencies are and which compilation flags to use). While it would technically be possible to achieve the necessary level of control over rustc indirectly through Cargo, Soong would have no understanding of how the Cargo.toml (the Cargo build file) would influence the commands Cargo emits to rustc . Paired with the fact that Cargo evolves independently, this would severely restrict Soong’s ability to precisely control how build artifacts are created.

indirectly through Cargo, Soong would have no understanding of how the (the Cargo build file) would influence the commands Cargo emits to . Paired with the fact that Cargo evolves independently, this would severely restrict Soong’s ability to precisely control how build artifacts are created. Builds which are self-contained and insensitive to the host configuration, known as hermetic builds , are necessary for Android to produce reproducible builds. Cargo, which relies on build.rs scripts, doesn’t yet provide hermeticity guarantees.

, are necessary for Android to produce reproducible builds. Cargo, which relies on scripts, doesn’t yet provide hermeticity guarantees. Incremental builds are important to maintain engineering productivity; building Android takes a considerable amount of resources. Cargo was not designed for integration into existing build systems and does not expose its compilation units. Each Cargo invocation builds the entire crate dependency graph for a given Cargo.toml , rebuilding crates multiple times across projects 1 . This is too coarse for integration into Soong’s incremental build support, which expects smaller compilation units. This support is necessary to scale up Rust usage within Android. Using the Rust compiler directly allows us to avoid these issues and is consistent with how we compile all other code in AOSP. It provides the most control over the build process and eases integration into Android’s existing build system. Unfortunately, avoiding it introduces several challenges and influences many other build system decisions because Cargo usage is so deeply ingrained in the Rust crate ecosystem. No build.rs scripts A build.rs script compiles to a Rust binary which Cargo builds and executes during a build to handle pre-build tasks, commonly setting up the build environment, or building libraries in other languages (for example C/C++). This is analogous to configure scripts used for other languages. Avoiding build.rs scripts somewhat flows naturally from not relying on Cargo since supporting these would require replicating Cargo behavior and assumptions. Beyond this however, there are good reasons for AOSP to avoid build scripts as well: build.rs scripts can execute arbitrary code on the build host. From a security perspective, this introduces an additional burden when adding or updating third-party code as the build.rs script needs careful scrutiny. Third-party build.rs scripts may not be hermetic or reproducible in potentially subtle ways. It is also common for build.rs files to access files outside the build directory (such as /usr/lib ). When they are not hermetic, we would need to either carry a local patch or work with upstream to resolve the issue. The most common task for build.rs is to build C libraries which Rust code depends on. We already support this through Soong. Android likewise avoids running build scripts while building for other languages, instead, simply using them to inform the structure of the Android.bp file.

, rebuilding crates multiple times across projects . This is too coarse for integration into Soong’s incremental build support, which expects smaller compilation units. This support is necessary to scale up Rust usage within Android.

For instances in third-party code where a build script is used only to compile C dependencies, we either use existing cc_library Soong definitions (such as boringssl for quiche) or create new definitions for crate-specific code.

When the build.rs is used to generate source, we try to replicate the core functionality in a Soong rust_binary module for use as a custom source generator. In other cases where Soong can provide the information without source generation, we may carry a small patch that leverages this information.

Why proc_macro but not build.rs?

Why do we support proc_macros , which are compiler plug-ins that execute code on the host within the compiler context, but not build.rs scripts?

While build.rs code is written as one-off code to handle building a single crate, proc_macros define reusable functionality within the compiler which can become widely relied upon across the Rust community. As a result popular proc_macros are generally better maintained and more scrutinized upstream, which makes the code review process more manageable. They are also more readily sandboxed as part of the build process since they are less likely to have dependencies external to the compiler.

proc_macros are also a language feature rather than a method for building code. These are relied upon by source code, are unavoidable for third-party dependencies, and are useful enough to define and use within our platform code. While we can avoid build.rs by leveraging our build system, the same can’t be said of proc_macros.

There is also precedence for compiler plugin support within the Android build system. For example see Soong’s java_plugin modules.

Generated source as crates

Unlike C/C++ compilers, rustc only accepts a single source file representing an entry point to a binary or library. It expects that the source tree is structured such that all required source files can be automatically discovered. This means that generated source either needs to be placed in the source tree or provided through an include directive in source:

include!(""/path/to/hello.rs"");

The Rust community depends on build.rs scripts alongside assumptions about the Cargo build environment to get around this limitation. When building, the cargo command sets an OUT_DIR environment variable which build.rs scripts are expected to place generated source code in. This source can then be included via:

include!(concat!(env!(""OUT_DIR""), ""/hello.rs""));

This presents a challenge for Soong as outputs for each module are placed in their own out/ directory2; there is no single OUT_DIR where dependencies output their generated source.

For platform code, we prefer to package generated source into a crate that can be imported. There are a few reasons to favor this approach:"

This is supported by Windows 20H1 (December Update) or later, running on processors with Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET) such as Intel 11th Gen or AMD Zen 3 CPUs. With this mitigation the processor maintains a new, protected, stack of valid return addresses (a shadow stack). This improves security by making exploits more difficult to write. However, it may affect stability if software that loads itself into Chrome is not compatible with the mitigation. Below we describe some exploitation techniques that are mitigated by stack protection, discuss its limitations and what we will do next to approach them. Finally, we provide some quick tips for other software authors as they enable /cetcompat for their Windows applications. </p><div style=""text-align: left;""><b>Stack Protection</b></div>  <p>Imagine a simple use-after-free (UAF) bug where an attacker can induce a program to call a pointer of their choosing. Here the attacker controls an object which occupies space formerly used by another object, which the program erroneously continues to use. The attacker sets a field in this region that is used as a function call to the address of code the attacker would like to execute. Years ago an attacker could simply write their shellcode to a known location, then, in their overwrite, set the instruction pointer to this shellcode. In time, Data Execution Prevention was added to prevent stacks or heaps from being executable. </p><p>In response, attackers invented Return Oriented Programming (ROP). Here, attackers take advantage of the process’s own code, as that must be executable. With control of the stack (either to write values there, or by changing the stack pointer) and control of the instruction pointer, an attacker can use the `ret` instruction to jump to a different, useful, piece of code. </p><div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: left;""><div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-e5wJwrbaRxA/YJB5OPO8DZI/AAAAAAAADv8/1dn4WDMchucpjdXmzYOK8t5zT_AVOIrfwCNcBGAsYHQ/s1010/rop.gif"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-e5wJwrbaRxA/YJB5OPO8DZI/AAAAAAAADv8/1dn4WDMchucpjdXmzYOK8t5zT_AVOIrfwCNcBGAsYHQ/s16000/rop.gif"" /></a></div></div><p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-305e2786-7fff-3ca1-89b3-6685107e2bd1""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""></span></span></p><p>During an exploit attempt, the instruction pointer is changed so that instead of its normal destination, a small fragment of code, called an ROP gadget, is invoked instead. These gadgets are selected so that they do something useful (such as prepare a register for a function call) then call return. </p><p>These tiny fragments need not be a complete function in the normal program, and could even be found part-way through a legitimate instruction. By lining up the right set of “return” addresses, a chain of these gadgets can be called, with each gadget’s `ret` switching to the next gadget. With some patience, or the right tooling, an attacker can piece together the arguments to a function call, then really call the function. </p><p>Chrome has a <a href=""https://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/small_04.html"">multi-process architecture</a> -- a main browser process acts as the logged-in user, and spawns restricted renderer and utility processes to host website code. This isolation reduces the severity of a bug in a renderer as its process cannot do much by itself. Attackers will then attempt to use another sandbox escape bug to run code in the browser, which lets them act as the logged-in user. As libraries are mapped at the same address in different processes by Windows, any bug that allows an attacker to read memory is enough for them to examine Chrome’s binary and any loaded libraries for ROP gadgets. This makes preventing ROP chains in the browser process especially useful as a mitigation. </p><p>Enter stack-protection. Along with the existing stack, the cpu maintains a shadow stack. This stack cannot be directly manipulated by normal program code and only stores return addresses. The CALL instruction is modified to push a return address (the instruction after the CALL) to both the normal stack, and the shadow stack. The RET (return) instruction still takes its return address from the normal stack, but now verifies that it is the same as the one stored in the shadow stack region. If it is, then the program is left alone and it continues to work as it always did. If the addresses do not match then an exception is raised which is intercepted by the operating system (not by Chrome). The operating system has an opportunity to modify  the shadow region and allow the program to continue, but in most cases an address mismatch is the result of a program error so the program is immediately terminated.</p><p></p><div class=""separator"" style=""clear: both; text-align: center;""><a href=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7l5W81xp6OE/YJB5ZrmIdxI/AAAAAAAADwA/L8U5ED5VwBQT10p0ipxJhZ7IQx_h9ptyACNcBGAsYHQ/s1010/cet.gif"" style=""margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;""><img border=""0"" src=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7l5W81xp6OE/YJB5ZrmIdxI/AAAAAAAADwA/L8U5ED5VwBQT10p0ipxJhZ7IQx_h9ptyACNcBGAsYHQ/s16000/cet.gif"" /></a></div><p></p><p><span id=""docs-internal-guid-3e3d108d-7fff-216f-b344-d24f6b3f395d""><span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;""></span></span></p><p>In our example above, the attacker will be able to make their initial jump into a ROP gadget, but on trying to return to their next gadget they will be stopped. </p><p>Some software may be incompatible with this mechanism, especially some older security software that injects into a process and hooks operating system functions by overwriting the prelude with `rax = &amp;hook; push rax; ret`. </p><div style=""text-align: left;""><b>Limitations</b></div>  <p>Chrome does not yet support every direction of control flow enforcement. Stack protection enforces the reverse-edge of the call graph but does not constrain the forward-edge. It will still be possible to make indirect jumps around existing code as stack protection is only validated when a return instruction is encountered, and call targets are not validated. On Windows a technology called Control Flow Guard (CFG) can be used to verify the target of an indirect function call before it is attempted. This prevents calling into the middle of a function, significantly reducing the scope of useful instructions for attackers to use. Another approach is provided by Intel’s CET which includes an ENDBRANCH instruction to prevent jumps into arbitrary code locations. Memory tagging tools such as MTE can be used to make it more difficult to modify pointers to valid code sequences (and makes UAFs more difficult in general). We are <a href=""https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=584575"">working to introduce CFG</a> to Chrome for Windows, and will add other techniques over time. </p><p>By itself, stack protection can be bypassed in some contexts. For instance, stack protection does not prevent an attacker tricking a program into calling an existing function by entirely replacing an object containing a function pointer. This approach does not involve ROP as the function call happens instead of the expected call, and returns to the address it was originally called from, so must be allowed. However, the called function must be useful to an attacker, and most functions will not be. An example of an attack using this method is to craft a call to add the `--no-sandbox` argument to Chrome’s command line. This results in future renderers being launched without normal protections. Over time we will identify and <a href=""https://crbug.com/1195976"">remove</a> such useful tools. </p><p>In the renderer, for performance reasons, our javascript and wasm engines may use memory that is both writable and executable at the same time. This allows an attacker to modify code that v8 is already going to execute, saving them the trouble of constructing a ROP chain.

This is supported by Windows 20H1 (December Update) or later, running on processors with Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET) such as Intel 11th Gen or AMD Zen 3 CPUs. With this mitigation the processor maintains a new, protected, stack of valid return addresses (a shadow stack). This improves security by making exploits more difficult to write. However, it may affect stability if software that loads itself into Chrome is not compatible with the mitigation. Below we describe some exploitation techniques that are mitigated by stack protection, discuss its limitations and what we will do next to approach them. Finally, we provide some quick tips for other software authors as they enable /cetcompat for their Windows applications.

Stack Protection

Imagine a simple use-after-free (UAF) bug where an attacker can induce a program to call a pointer of their choosing. Here the attacker controls an object which occupies space formerly used by another object, which the program erroneously continues to use. The attacker sets a field in this region that is used as a function call to the address of code the attacker would like to execute. Years ago an attacker could simply write their shellcode to a known location, then, in their overwrite, set the instruction pointer to this shellcode. In time, Data Execution Prevention was added to prevent stacks or heaps from being executable.

In response, attackers invented Return Oriented Programming (ROP). Here, attackers take advantage of the process’s own code, as that must be executable. With control of the stack (either to write values there, or by changing the stack pointer) and control of the instruction pointer, an attacker can use the `ret` instruction to jump to a different, useful, piece of code.

During an exploit attempt, the instruction pointer is changed so that instead of its normal destination, a small fragment of code, called an ROP gadget, is invoked instead. These gadgets are selected so that they do something useful (such as prepare a register for a function call) then call return.

These tiny fragments need not be a complete function in the normal program, and could even be found part-way through a legitimate instruction. By lining up the right set of “return” addresses, a chain of these gadgets can be called, with each gadget’s `ret` switching to the next gadget. With some patience, or the right tooling, an attacker can piece together the arguments to a function call, then really call the function.

Chrome has a multi-process architecture -- a main browser process acts as the logged-in user, and spawns restricted renderer and utility processes to host website code. This isolation reduces the severity of a bug in a renderer as its process cannot do much by itself. Attackers will then attempt to use another sandbox escape bug to run code in the browser, which lets them act as the logged-in user. As libraries are mapped at the same address in different processes by Windows, any bug that allows an attacker to read memory is enough for them to examine Chrome’s binary and any loaded libraries for ROP gadgets. This makes preventing ROP chains in the browser process especially useful as a mitigation.

Enter stack-protection. Along with the existing stack, the cpu maintains a shadow stack. This stack cannot be directly manipulated by normal program code and only stores return addresses. The CALL instruction is modified to push a return address (the instruction after the CALL) to both the normal stack, and the shadow stack. The RET (return) instruction still takes its return address from the normal stack, but now verifies that it is the same as the one stored in the shadow stack region. If it is, then the program is left alone and it continues to work as it always did. If the addresses do not match then an exception is raised which is intercepted by the operating system (not by Chrome). The operating system has an opportunity to modify the shadow region and allow the program to continue, but in most cases an address mismatch is the result of a program error so the program is immediately terminated.

In our example above, the attacker will be able to make their initial jump into a ROP gadget, but on trying to return to their next gadget they will be stopped.

Some software may be incompatible with this mechanism, especially some older security software that injects into a process and hooks operating system functions by overwriting the prelude with `rax = &hook; push rax; ret`.

Limitations

Chrome does not yet support every direction of control flow enforcement. Stack protection enforces the reverse-edge of the call graph but does not constrain the forward-edge. It will still be possible to make indirect jumps around existing code as stack protection is only validated when a return instruction is encountered, and call targets are not validated. On Windows a technology called Control Flow Guard (CFG) can be used to verify the target of an indirect function call before it is attempted. This prevents calling into the middle of a function, significantly reducing the scope of useful instructions for attackers to use. Another approach is provided by Intel’s CET which includes an ENDBRANCH instruction to prevent jumps into arbitrary code locations. Memory tagging tools such as MTE can be used to make it more difficult to modify pointers to valid code sequences (and makes UAFs more difficult in general). We are working to introduce CFG to Chrome for Windows, and will add other techniques over time.

By itself, stack protection can be bypassed in some contexts. For instance, stack protection does not prevent an attacker tricking a program into calling an existing function by entirely replacing an object containing a function pointer. This approach does not involve ROP as the function call happens instead of the expected call, and returns to the address it was originally called from, so must be allowed. However, the called function must be useful to an attacker, and most functions will not be. An example of an attack using this method is to craft a call to add the `--no-sandbox` argument to Chrome’s command line. This results in future renderers being launched without normal protections. Over time we will identify and remove such useful tools.

In the renderer, for performance reasons, our javascript and wasm engines may use memory that is both writable and executable at the same time. This allows an attacker to modify code that v8 is already going to execute, saving them the trouble of constructing a ROP chain. This explains why it was not our first priority to make v8 CET compatible, and why stack-protection is not yet enabled in the renderer.

Finally, stack protection doesn’t stop the bugs in the first place. Everything we have discussed above is a mitigation that makes it more difficult to execute arbitrary code. If a programming error allows arbitrary writes then it is very unlikely that we can prevent this being used to run arbitrary code. Attackers will adapt and find new ways to turn memory safety errors into code execution.

Debugging Tips

You can see if Hardware-enforced Stack Protection is enabled for a process using the Windows Task Manager. Open task manager, open the Details Tab, Right Click on a heading, Select Columns & Check the Hardware-enforced Stack Protection box. The process display will then indicate if a process is opted-in to this mitigation. ‘Compatible Modules Only’ indicates that any dll marked as /cetcompat at build time will raise an exception if a return address is invalid.

You can see which Chrome processes are opted-out of CET by consulting the Mitigations field of chrome://sandbox and clicking ‘+’. All processes are included unless the mitigation CET_USER_SHADOW_STACKS_ALWAYS_OFF is present in the expanded details view.

If you are developing software, or debugging a problem in Chrome the shadow stack can be helpful as it includes only return addresses, and these cannot be corrupted by rogue writes elsewhere in the process. To see these registers use the `r` command in windbg with the mask option:

0:159> rM 8002

rax=00000000c000060a rbx=000000fa5bbfeff0 rcx=0000000000000030

rdx=0000000000000000 rsi=00007ffba4118924 rdi=000000fa5bbff1a0

rip=00007ffc1847b4a1 rsp=000000fa5bbfc0a0 rbp=000000fa5bbfc0a0

r8=000000fa5bbfc098 r9=0000000000000000 r10=0000000000000000

r11=0000000000000246 r12=000000fa5bbfe230 r13=000002c3450b5830

r14=000002c3450b7850 r15=000000fa5bbfc260

iopl=0 nv up ei pl zr na po nc

ssp=000000fa5c3fef10 cetumsr=0000000000000001

`ssp` points to the shadow stack region, `cetumsr` indicates if cet is enabled for the process.

You can then see the call stack within the shadow region using `dps @ssp`. Values are not overwritten so you can also see where you came from by looking a bit deeper: `dps @ssp-20`.

If a process is not compatible with Hardware-enforced Stack Protection, the system event log (Application Log) will include brief error reports (Id:1001). You can filter those related to cetcompat using the following powershell snippet:-

Get-WinEvent -MaxEvents 128 -FilterHashtable @{ LogName='Application'; Id='1001' } `

| Where-Object {$_.Message -match 'chrome.exe'} `

| Select-Object -First 8 `

| fl

These will include the following parameters:-

P1: application.exe

P2: application version

P3: application build ts

P4: faulting module .dll

P5: faulting module version

P6: faulting module build ts

P7: faulting offset in P4 from base_address

P8: exception code (c0000409)

P9: subcode (00...000030)

If Chrome is misbehaving and you think it might be because of cetcompat, it is possible to disable it using Image File Execution Options - we do not recommend this except for a limited period of testing. If you find you have to do this, please raise an issue on https://crbug.com so that we can investigate the failure.

Related to this, we are also participating in the effort to evaluate the use of Rust as a supported language for developing the Linux kernel. In this post, we discuss some technical aspects of this work using a few simple examples. </p>  <p>C has been the language of choice for writing kernels for almost half a century because it offers the level of control and predictable performance required by such a critical component. Density of memory safety bugs in the Linux kernel is generally quite low due to high code quality, high standards of code review, and carefully implemented safeguards. However, <a href=""https://events19.linuxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Syzbot-and-the-Tale-of-Thousand-Kernel-Bugs-Dmitry-Vyukov-Google.pdf"">memory safety bugs do still regularly occur</a>. On Android, vulnerabilities in the kernel are generally considered high-severity because they can result in a security model bypass due to the privileged mode that the kernel runs in. </p>  <p>We feel that Rust is now ready to join C as a practical language for implementing the kernel. It can help us reduce the number of potential bugs and security vulnerabilities in privileged code while playing nicely with the core kernel and preserving its performance characteristics. </p>  <h1>Supporting Rust</h1>  <p>We developed an <a href=""https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux/commit/d8dcaf80c9535056ea541d8dd876edad52c538a9#diff-8aa818b39daaf6497eaab2ec0b404bcabf43616362fe9551ed7dd2278682af08"">initial prototype</a> of the Binder driver to allow us to make meaningful comparisons between the safety and performance characteristics of the existing C version and its Rust counterpart. The Linux kernel has over 30 million lines of code, so naturally our goal is not to convert it all to Rust but rather to allow new code to be written in Rust. We believe this incremental approach allows us to benefit from the kernel’s existing high-performance implementation while providing kernel developers with new tools to improve memory safety and maintain performance going forward. </p>  <p>We joined the <a href=""https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux"">Rust for Linux</a> organization, where the community had already done and continues to do great work toward adding Rust support to the Linux kernel build system. We also need designs that allow code in the two languages to interact with each other: we're particularly interested in safe, zero-cost abstractions that allow Rust code to use kernel functionality written in C, and how to implement functionality in idiomatic Rust that can be called seamlessly from the C portions of the kernel.</p>  <p>Since Rust is a new language for the kernel, we also have the opportunity to enforce best practices in terms of documentation and uniformity. For example, we have specific machine-checked requirements around the usage of unsafe code: for every unsafe function, the developer must document the requirements that need to be satisfied by callers to ensure that its usage is safe; additionally, for every call to unsafe functions (or usage of unsafe constructs like dereferencing a raw pointer), the developer must document the justification for why it is safe to do so. </p>  <p>Just as important as safety, Rust support needs to be convenient and helpful for developers to use. Let’s get into a few examples of how Rust can assist kernel developers in writing drivers that are safe and correct. </p>  <h1>Example driver</h1>  <p>We'll use an implementation of a <b>semaphore</b> character device. Each device has a current value; writes of <i>n</i> bytes result in the device value being incremented by <i>n</i>; reads decrement the value by 1 unless the value is 0, in which case they will block until they can decrement the count without going below 0. </p>  <p>  Suppose <span style=""font-family: courier;"">semaphore</span> is a file representing our device. We can interact with it from the shell as follows: </p>  <p style=""font-family: courier;""> &gt; cat semaphore </p>  <p>  When <span style=""font-family: courier;"">semaphore</span> is a newly initialized device, the command above will block because the device's current value is 0. It will be unblocked if we run the following command from another shell because it increments the value by 1, which allows the original read to complete: </p>  <p style=""font-family: courier;"">&gt; echo -n a &gt; semaphore </p>   <p>We could also increment the count by more than 1 if we write more data, for example: </p>  <p style=""font-family: courier;"">&gt; echo -n abc &gt; semaphore </p><p>increments the count by 3, so the next 3 reads won't block. </p>  <p>To allow us to show a few more aspects of Rust, we'll add the following features to our driver: remember what the maximum value was throughout the lifetime of a device, and remember how many reads each file issued on the device. </p>  <p>We'll now show how such a driver would be <a href=""https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux/blob/e2382072517dd0b6b65d4e179e322f392efb9676/samples/rust/rust_semaphore.rs"">implemented in Rust</a>, contrasting it with a <a href=""https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux/blob/e2382072517dd0b6b65d4e179e322f392efb9676/samples/rust/rust_semaphore_c.c"">C implementation</a>. We note, however, we are still early on so this is all subject to change in the future. How Rust can assist the developer is the aspect that we'd like to emphasize. For example, at compile time it allows us to eliminate or greatly reduce the chances of introducing classes of bugs, while at the same time remaining flexible and having minimal overhead. </p>  <h2>Character devices</h2>  <p>A developer needs to do the following to implement a driver for a new character device in Rust: </p><ol style=""text-align: left;"">  <li>Implement the <a href=""https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux/blob/150939383ef391e3cab72aec1beaa6d65fe80c5b/rust/kernel/file_operations.rs#L448""><span style=""font-family: courier;"">FileOperations</span></a> trait: all associated functions are optional, so the developer only needs to implement the relevant ones for   their scenario. They relate to the fields in C's <a href=""https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.11.11/source/include/linux/fs.h#L1820""><span style=""font-family: courier;"">struct file_operations</span></a>.   </li>  <li>Implement the <a href=""https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux/blob/150939383ef391e3cab72aec1beaa6d65fe80c5b/rust/kernel/file_operations.rs#L434""><span style=""font-family: courier;"">FileOpener</span></a> trait: it is a type-safe equivalent to C's <span style=""font-family: courier;"">open</span> field of <span style=""font-family: courier;"">struct file_operations</span>.</li>  <li>Register the new device type with the kernel: this lets the kernel know what functions need to be called in response to files of this new type being operated on.</li></ol>  <p>The following outlines how the first two steps of our example compare in Rust and C: </p>  <center><table style=""border-collapse: collapse;""><tbody><tr><td style=""background: rgb(240, 240, 240);

Any object that implements the <span style=""font-family: courier;""><a href=""https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux/blob/150939383ef391e3cab72aec1beaa6d65fe80c5b/rust/kernel/file_operations.rs#L516"">PointerWrapper</a></span> trait can be returned, and we provide implementations for <span style=""font-family: courier;""><a href=""https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html"">Box&lt;T&gt;</a></span> and <span style=""font-family: courier;""><a href=""https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html"">Arc&lt;T&gt;</a></span>, so developers that use Rust's idiomatic heap-allocated or reference-counted pointers have no additional requirements. <br /><br />All associated functions in <span style=""font-family: courier;"">FileOperations</span> receive non-mutable references to <span style=""font-family: courier;"">self</span> (more about this below), except the <span style=""font-family: courier;"">release</span> function, which is the last function to be called and receives the plain object back (and its ownership with it). The <span style=""font-family: courier;"">release</span> implementation can then defer the object destruction by transferring its ownership elsewhere, or destroy it then; in the case of a reference-counted object, 'destruction' means decrementing the reference count (and actual object destruction if the count goes to zero). <br /><br />That is, we use Rust's ownership discipline when interacting with C code by handing the C portion ownership of a Rust object, allowing it to call functions implemented in Rust, then eventually giving ownership back. So as long as the C code is correct, the lifetime of Rust file objects work seamlessly as well, with the compiler enforcing correct lifetime management on the Rust side, for example: open cannot return stack-allocated pointers or heap-allocated objects containing pointers to the stack, <span style=""font-family: courier;"">ioctl</span>/<span style=""font-family: courier;"">read</span>/<span style=""font-family: courier;"">write</span> cannot free (or modify without synchronization) the contents of the object stored in <span style=""font-family: courier;"">filp-&gt;private_data</span>, etc.   <br /><br />  </li>     <li>Non-mutable references: the associated functions called between <span style=""font-family: courier;"">open</span> and <span style=""font-family: courier;"">release</span> all receive non-mutable references to <span style=""font-family: courier;"">self</span> because they can be called concurrently by multiple threads and Rust aliasing rules prohibit more than one mutable reference to an object at any given time. <br /><br />If a developer needs to modify some state (and they generally do), they can do so via <i><a href=""https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/interior-mutability.html"">interior mutability</a></i>: mutable state can be wrapped in a <span style=""font-family: courier;""><a href=""https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux/blob/150939383ef391e3cab72aec1beaa6d65fe80c5b/rust/kernel/sync/mutex.rs#L29"">Mutex&lt;T&gt;</a></span> or <span style=""font-family: courier;""><a href=""https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux/blob/150939383ef391e3cab72aec1beaa6d65fe80c5b/rust/kernel/sync/spinlock.rs#L45"">SpinLock&lt;T&gt;</a></span> (or <a href=""https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/sync/atomic/"">atomics</a>) and safely modified through them. <br /><br />This prevents, at compile-time, bugs where a developer fails to acquire the appropriate lock when accessing a field (the field is inaccessible), or when a developer fails to wrap a field with a lock (the field is read-only). <br /><br /></li>            <li>Per-device state: when file instances need to share per-device state, which is a very common occurrence in drivers, they can do so safely in Rust. When a device is registered, a typed object can be provided and a non-mutable reference to it is provided when <span style=""font-family: courier;"">FileOperation::open</span> is called. In our example, the shared object is wrapped in <span style=""font-family: courier;"">Arc&lt;T&gt;</span>, so files can safely clone and hold on to a reference to them. <br /><br />The reason <span style=""font-family: courier;"">FileOperation</span> is its own trait (as opposed to, for example, <span style=""font-family: courier;"">open</span> being part of the <span style=""font-family: courier;"">FileOperations</span> trait) is to allow a single file implementation to be registered in different ways. <br /><br />This eliminates opportunities for developers to get the wrong data when trying to retrieve shared state. For example, in C when a <span style=""font-family: courier;""><a href=""https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.11.11/source/include/linux/miscdevice.h#L79"">miscdevice</a></span> is registered, a pointer to it is available in <span style=""font-family: courier;"">filp-&gt;private_data</span>; when a <a href=""https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.11.11/source/include/linux/cdev.h#L14""><span style=""font-family: courier;"">cdev</span></a> is registered, a pointer to it is available in <span style=""font-family: courier;"">inode-&gt;i_cdev</span>. These structs are usually embedded in an outer struct that contains the shared state, so developers usually use the <a href=""https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.11.11/source/include/linux/kernel.h#L685""><span style=""font-family: courier;"">container_of</span></a> macro to recover the shared state. Rust encapsulates all of this and the potentially troublesome pointer casts in a safe abstraction.       <br /><br /></li>     <li>    Static typing: we take advantage of Rust's support for generics to implement all of the above functions and types with static types. So there are no opportunities for a developer to convert an untyped variable or field to the wrong type. The C code in the table above has casts from an essentially untyped (<span style=""font-family: courier;"">void</span> *) pointer to the desired type at the start of each function: this is likely to work fine when first written, but may lead to bugs as the code evolves and assumptions change. Rust would catch any such mistakes at compile time.<br /><br />  </li>     <li>    File operations: as we mentioned before, a developer needs to implement the <span style=""font-family: courier;"">FileOperations</span> trait to customize the behavior of their device. They do this with a block starting with <span style=""font-family: courier;"">impl FileOperations for Device</span>, where <span style=""font-family: courier;"">Device</span> is the type implementing the file behavior (<span style=""font-family: courier;"">FileState</span> in our example). Once inside this block, tools know that only a limited number of functions can be defined, so they can automatically insert the prototypes. (Personally, I use <span style=""font-family: courier;""><a href=""https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig"">neovim</a></span> and the <a href=""https://rust-analyzer.github.io/""><span style=""font-family: courier;"">rust-analyzer</span></a> LSP server.) <br /><br />While we use this trait in Rust, the C portion of the kernel still requires an instance of <span style=""font-family: courier;"">struct file_operations</span>. The kernel crate automatically generates one from the trait implementation (and optionally the <span style=""font-family: courier;""><a href=""https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux/blob/150939383ef391e3cab72aec1beaa6d65fe80c5b/rust/kernel/file_operations.rs#L309"">declare_file_operations</a></span> macro): although it has code to generate the correct struct, it is all <span style=""font-family: courier;"">const</span>, so evaluated at compile-time with zero runtime cost.   </li></ul>  <h2>Ioctl handling</h2>  <p>For a driver to provide a custom <a href=""https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioctl.2.html"">ioctl</a> handler, it needs to implement the&nbsp;<span style=""font-family: courier;"">ioctl</span> function that is part of the <span style=""font-family: courier;"">FileOperations</span> trait, as exemplified in the table below. </p><p>  </p><center><table style=""border-collapse: collapse;""><tbody><tr><td style=""background: rgb(240, 240, 240);

In Rust, we provide a <a href=""https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux/blob/150939383ef391e3cab72aec1beaa6d65fe80c5b/rust/kernel/file_operations.rs#L386"">dispatcher</a> (accessible by calling <span style=""font-family: courier;"">cmd.dispatch</span>) that uses this information to automatically create user memory access helpers and pass them to the caller. </p>  <p>A driver is not <i>required</i> to use this though. If, for example, it doesn't use the standard ioctl encoding, Rust offers the flexibility of simply calling <span style=""font-family: courier;"">cmd.raw</span> to extract the raw arguments and using them to handle the ioctl (potentially with unsafe code, which will need to be justified). </p>  <p>However, if a driver implementation does use the standard dispatcher, it will benefit from not having to implement any unsafe code, and: </p>  <ul style=""text-align: left;"">  <li>The pointer to user memory is never a native pointer, so the developer cannot accidentally dereference it. </li>  <li>The types that allow the driver to read from user space only allow data to be read once, so we eliminate the risk of time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) bugs because when a driver needs to access data twice, it needs to copy it to kernel memory, where an attacker is not allowed to modify it. Excluding unsafe blocks, there is no way to introduce this class of bugs in Rust. </li>  <li>No accidental overflow of the user buffer: we'll never read or write past the end of the user buffer because this is enforced automatically based on the size encoded in the ioctl command. In our example above, the implementation of <span style=""font-family: courier;"">IOCTL_GET_READ_COUNT</span> only has access to an instance of <a href=""https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux/blob/150939383ef391e3cab72aec1beaa6d65fe80c5b/rust/kernel/user_ptr.rs#L230""><span style=""font-family: courier;"">UserSlicePtrWriter</span></a>, which limits the number of writable bytes to <span style=""font-family: courier;"">sizeof(u64)</span> as encoded in the ioctl command. </li>  <li>No mixing of reads and writes: we'll never write buffers for ioctls that are only meant to read and never read buffers for ioctls that are only meant to write. This is enforced by read and write handlers only getting instances of <a href=""https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux/blob/150939383ef391e3cab72aec1beaa6d65fe80c5b/rust/kernel/user_ptr.rs#L230""><span style=""font-family: courier;"">UserSlicePtrWriter</span></a> and <a href=""https://github.com/Rust-for-Linux/linux/blob/150939383ef391e3cab72aec1beaa6d65fe80c5b/rust/kernel/user_ptr.rs#L158""><span style=""font-family: courier;"">UserSlicePtrReader</span></a> respectively. </li></ul>  <p>All of the above could potentially also be done in C, but it's very easy for developers to (likely unintentionally) break contracts that lead to unsafety; Rust requires <span style=""font-family: courier;"">unsafe</span> blocks for this, which should only be used in rare cases and brings additional scrutiny. Additionally, Rust offers the following: </p>  <ul style=""text-align: left;"">  <li>The types used to read and write user memory do not implement the <span style=""font-family: courier;""><a href=""https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html"">Send</a></span> and <span style=""font-family: courier;""><a href=""https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html"">Sync</a></span> traits, which means that they (and pointers to them) are not safe to be used in another thread context. In Rust, if a driver developer attempted to write code that passed one of these objects to another thread (where it wouldn't be safe to use them because it isn't necessarily in the right memory manager context), they would get a compilation error.</li>  <li>When calling <span style=""font-family: courier;"">IoctlCommand::dispatch</span>, one might understandably think that we need dynamic dispatching to reach the actual handler implementation (which would incur additional cost in comparison to C), but we don't. Our usage of generics will lead the compiler to monomorphize the function, which will result in static function calls that can even be inlined if the optimizer so chooses. </li></ul>    <h2>Locking and condition variables</h2>   <p>We allow developers to use mutexes and spinlocks to provide interior mutability.

So developers cannot accidentally read or write protected data without locking it first. In the C example above, <span style=""font-family: courier;"">count</span> and <span style=""font-family: courier;"">max_seen</span> in <span style=""font-family: courier;"">semaphore_state</span> are protected by <span style=""font-family: courier;"">mutex</span>, but there is no enforcement that the lock is held while they're accessed. </li>  <li>Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII): the lock is unlocked automatically when the guard (<span style=""font-family: courier;"">inner</span> in this case) goes out of scope. This ensures that locks are always unlocked: if the developer needs to keep a lock locked, they can keep the guard alive, for example, by returning the guard itself; conversely, if they need to unlock before the end of the scope, they can explicitly do it by calling the <span style=""font-family: courier;"">drop</span> function. </li>  <li>Developers can use any lock that implements the <span style=""font-family: courier;"">Lock</span> trait, which includes <span style=""font-family: courier;"">Mutex</span> and <span style=""font-family: courier;"">SpinLock</span>, at no additional runtime cost when compared to a C implementation. Other synchronization constructs, including condition variables, also work transparently and with zero additional run-time cost. </li>  <li>Rust implements condition variables using kernel wait queues. This allows developers to benefit from atomic release of the lock and putting the thread to sleep without having to reason about low-level kernel scheduler functions. In the C example above, <span style=""font-family: courier;"">semaphore_consume</span> is a mix of semaphore logic and subtle Linux scheduling: for example, the code is incorrect if <span style=""font-family: courier;"">mutex_unlock</span> is called before <span style=""font-family: courier;"">prepare_to_wait</span> because it may result in a wake up being missed. </li>  <li>No unsynchronized access: as we mentioned before, variables shared by multiple threads/CPUs must be read-only, with interior mutability being the solution for cases when mutability is needed. In addition to the example with locks above, the ioctl example in the previous section also has an example of using an atomic variable; Rust also requires developers to specify how memory is to <a href=""https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/sync/atomic/enum.Ordering.html"">be synchronized</a> by atomic accesses. In the C part of the example, we happen to use <span style=""font-family: courier;"">atomic64_t</span>, but the compiler won't alert a developer to this need. </li>  </ul>  <h2>Error handling and control flow</h2>  <p>In the tables below, we show how <span style=""font-family: courier;"">open</span>, <span style=""font-family: courier;"">read</span>, and <span style=""font-family: courier;"">write</span> are implemented in our example driver: </p>  <center><table style=""border-collapse: collapse;""><tbody><tr><td style=""background: rgb(240, 240, 240);

the developer can focus on the semaphore logic, the resulting code being quite small and readable. The C versions have error-handling noise that can make them less readable. </li>  <li>Required initialization: Rust requires all fields of a struct to be initialized on construction, so the developer can never accidentally fail to initialize a field; C offers no such facility. In our <span style=""font-family: courier;"">open</span> example above, the developer of the C version could easily fail to call <span style=""font-family: courier;"">kref_get</span> (even though all fields would have been initialized); in Rust, the user is required to call <span style=""font-family: courier;"">clone</span> (which increments the ref count), otherwise they get a compilation error. </li>  <li>RAII scoping: the Rust write implementation uses a statement block to control when <span style=""font-family: courier;"">inner</span> goes out of scope and therefore the lock is released. </li>  <li>Integer overflow behavior: Rust encourages developers to always consider how overflows should be handled. In our <span style=""font-family: courier;"">write</span> example, we want a saturating one so that we don't end up with a zero value when adding to our semaphore. In C, we need to manually check for overflows, there is no additional support from the compiler. </li></ul>  <h1>What's next</h1>  <p>The examples above are only a small part of the whole project. We hope it gives readers a glimpse of the kinds of benefits that Rust brings. At the moment we have nearly all generic kernel functionality needed by Binder neatly wrapped in safe Rust abstractions, so we are in the process of <a href=""https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210414184604.23473-1-ojeda@kernel.org/T/#mb5e524dae9d5a5815c6e68eb36b9bde4e87c861d"">gathering feedback from the broader Linux kernel community</a> with the intent of upstreaming the existing Rust support. </p>  <p>We also continue to make progress on our Binder prototype, implement additional abstractions, and smooth out some rough edges. This is an exciting time and a rare opportunity to potentially influence how the Linux kernel is developed, as well as inform the evolution of the Rust language.

We invite those interested to join us in Rust for Linux and attend our planned talk at Linux Plumbers Conference 2021!","In our previous post, we announced that Android now supports the Rust programming language for developing the OS itself. Related to this, we are also participating in the effort to evaluate the use of Rust as a supported language for developing the Linux kernel. In this post, we discuss some technical aspects of this work using a few simple examples.

C has been the language of choice for writing kernels for almost half a century because it offers the level of control and predictable performance required by such a critical component. Density of memory safety bugs in the Linux kernel is generally quite low due to high code quality, high standards of code review, and carefully implemented safeguards. However, memory safety bugs do still regularly occur. On Android, vulnerabilities in the kernel are generally considered high-severity because they can result in a security model bypass due to the privileged mode that the kernel runs in.

We feel that Rust is now ready to join C as a practical language for implementing the kernel. It can help us reduce the number of potential bugs and security vulnerabilities in privileged code while playing nicely with the core kernel and preserving its performance characteristics.

Supporting Rust

We developed an initial prototype of the Binder driver to allow us to make meaningful comparisons between the safety and performance characteristics of the existing C version and its Rust counterpart. The Linux kernel has over 30 million lines of code, so naturally our goal is not to convert it all to Rust but rather to allow new code to be written in Rust. We believe this incremental approach allows us to benefit from the kernel’s existing high-performance implementation while providing kernel developers with new tools to improve memory safety and maintain performance going forward.

We joined the Rust for Linux organization, where the community had already done and continues to do great work toward adding Rust support to the Linux kernel build system. We also need designs that allow code in the two languages to interact with each other: we're particularly interested in safe, zero-cost abstractions that allow Rust code to use kernel functionality written in C, and how to implement functionality in idiomatic Rust that can be called seamlessly from the C portions of the kernel.

Since Rust is a new language for the kernel, we also have the opportunity to enforce best practices in terms of documentation and uniformity. For example, we have specific machine-checked requirements around the usage of unsafe code: for every unsafe function, the developer must document the requirements that need to be satisfied by callers to ensure that its usage is safe; additionally, for every call to unsafe functions (or usage of unsafe constructs like dereferencing a raw pointer), the developer must document the justification for why it is safe to do so.

Just as important as safety, Rust support needs to be convenient and helpful for developers to use. Let’s get into a few examples of how Rust can assist kernel developers in writing drivers that are safe and correct.

Example driver

We'll use an implementation of a semaphore character device. Each device has a current value; writes of n bytes result in the device value being incremented by n; reads decrement the value by 1 unless the value is 0, in which case they will block until they can decrement the count without going below 0.

Suppose semaphore is a file representing our device. We can interact with it from the shell as follows:

> cat semaphore

When semaphore is a newly initialized device, the command above will block because the device's current value is 0. It will be unblocked if we run the following command from another shell because it increments the value by 1, which allows the original read to complete:

> echo -n a > semaphore

We could also increment the count by more than 1 if we write more data, for example:

> echo -n abc > semaphore

increments the count by 3, so the next 3 reads won't block.

To allow us to show a few more aspects of Rust, we'll add the following features to our driver: remember what the maximum value was throughout the lifetime of a device, and remember how many reads each file issued on the device.

We'll now show how such a driver would be implemented in Rust, contrasting it with a C implementation. We note, however, we are still early on so this is all subject to change in the future. How Rust can assist the developer is the aspect that we'd like to emphasize. For example, at compile time it allows us to eliminate or greatly reduce the chances of introducing classes of bugs, while at the same time remaining flexible and having minimal overhead.

Character devices

A developer needs to do the following to implement a driver for a new character device in Rust:

Implement the FileOperations trait: all associated functions are optional, so the developer only needs to implement the relevant ones for their scenario. They relate to the fields in C's struct file_operations . Implement the FileOpener trait: it is a type-safe equivalent to C's open field of struct file_operations . Register the new device type with the kernel: this lets the kernel know what functions need to be called in response to files of this new type being operated on.

The following outlines how the first two steps of our example compare in Rust and C:

impl FileOpener<Arc<Semaphore>> for FileState { fn open ( shared: &Arc<Semaphore> ) -> KernelResult< Box < Self >> { [...] } } impl FileOperations for FileState { type Wrapper = Box < Self >; fn read ( & self , _: &File, data: & mut UserSlicePtrWriter, offset: u64 ) -> KernelResult< usize > { [...] } fn write ( & self , data: & mut UserSlicePtrReader, _offset: u64 ) -> KernelResult< usize > { [...] } fn ioctl ( & self , file: &File, cmd: & mut IoctlCommand ) -> KernelResult< i32 > { [...] } fn release (_obj: Box < Self >, _file: &File) { [...] } declare_file_operations!(read, write, ioctl); } static int semaphore_open ( struct inode *nodp, struct file *filp) { struct semaphore_state *shared = container_of(filp->private_data, struct semaphore_state, miscdev); [...] } static ssize_t semaphore_write ( struct file *filp, const char __user *buffer, size_t count, loff_t *ppos) { struct file_state *state = filp->private_data; [...] } static ssize_t semaphore_read ( struct file *filp, char __user *buffer, size_t count, loff_t *ppos) { struct file_state *state = filp->private_data; [...] } static long semaphore_ioctl ( struct file *filp, unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg) { struct file_state *state = filp->private_data; [...] } static int semaphore_release ( struct inode *nodp, struct file *filp) { struct file_state *state = filp->private_data; [...] } static const struct file_operations semaphore_fops = { .owner = THIS_MODULE, .open = semaphore_open, .read = semaphore_read, .write = semaphore_write, .compat_ioctl = semaphore_ioctl, .release = semaphore_release, };

Character devices in Rust benefit from a number of safety features:

Per-file state lifetime management: FileOpener::open returns an object whose lifetime is owned by the caller from then on. Any object that implements the PointerWrapper Box<T> Arc<T>



All associated functions in FileOperations receive non-mutable references to self (more about this below), except the release function, which is the last function to be called and receives the plain object back (and its ownership with it). The release implementation can then defer the object destruction by transferring its ownership elsewhere, or destroy it then; in the case of a reference-counted object, 'destruction' means decrementing the reference count (and actual object destruction if the count goes to zero).



That is, we use Rust's ownership discipline when interacting with C code by handing the C portion ownership of a Rust object, allowing it to call functions implemented in Rust, then eventually giving ownership back. So as long as the C code is correct, the lifetime of Rust file objects work seamlessly as well, with the compiler enforcing correct lifetime management on the Rust side, for example: open cannot return stack-allocated pointers or heap-allocated objects containing pointers to the stack, ioctl / read / write cannot free (or modify without synchronization) the contents of the object stored in filp->private_data , etc.

If a developer needs to modify some state (and they generally do), they can do so via interior mutability : mutable state can be wrapped in a Mutex<T> SpinLock<T> atomics) and safely modified through them.



This prevents, at compile-time, bugs where a developer fails to acquire the appropriate lock when accessing a field (the field is inaccessible), or when a developer fails to wrap a field with a lock (the field is read-only).

This prevents, at compile-time, bugs where a developer fails to acquire the appropriate lock when accessing a field (the field is inaccessible), or when a developer fails to wrap a field with a lock (the field is read-only). Per-device state: when file instances need to share per-device state, which is a very common occurrence in drivers, they can do so safely in Rust. When a device is registered, a typed object can be provided and a non-mutable reference to it is provided when FileOperation::open is called. In our example, the shared object is wrapped in Arc<T> , so files can safely clone and hold on to a reference to them.



The reason FileOperation is its own trait (as opposed to, for example, open being part of the FileOperations trait) is to allow a single file implementation to be registered in different ways.



This eliminates opportunities for developers to get the wrong data when trying to retrieve shared state. For example, in C when a miscdevice filp->private_data ; when a cdev is registered, a pointer to it is available in inode->i_cdev . These structs are usually embedded in an outer struct that contains the shared state, so developers usually use the container_of macro to recover the shared state. Rust encapsulates all of this and the potentially troublesome pointer casts in a safe abstraction.

These structs are usually embedded in an outer struct that contains the shared state, so developers usually use the macro to recover the shared state. Rust encapsulates all of this and the potentially troublesome pointer casts in a safe abstraction. Static typing: we take advantage of Rust's support for generics to implement all of the above functions and types with static types. So there are no opportunities for a developer to convert an untyped variable or field to the wrong type. The C code in the table above has casts from an essentially untyped ( void *) pointer to the desired type at the start of each function: this is likely to work fine when first written, but may lead to bugs as the code evolves and assumptions change. Rust would catch any such mistakes at compile time.





*) pointer to the desired type at the start of each function: this is likely to work fine when first written, but may lead to bugs as the code evolves and assumptions change. Rust would catch any such mistakes at compile time. File operations: as we mentioned before, a developer needs to implement the FileOperations trait to customize the behavior of their device. They do this with a block starting with impl FileOperations for Device , where Device is the type implementing the file behavior ( FileState in our example). Once inside this block, tools know that only a limited number of functions can be defined, so they can automatically insert the prototypes. (Personally, I use neovim rust-analyzer LSP server.)



While we use this trait in Rust, the C portion of the kernel still requires an instance of struct file_operations . The kernel crate automatically generates one from the trait implementation (and optionally the declare_file_operations const , so evaluated at compile-time with zero runtime cost.

Ioctl handling

For a driver to provide a custom ioctl handler, it needs to implement the ioctl function that is part of the FileOperations trait, as exemplified in the table below.

fn ioctl ( & self , file: &File, cmd: & mut IoctlCommand ) -> KernelResult< i32 > { cmd.dispatch( self , file) } impl IoctlHandler for FileState { fn read ( & self , _file: &File, cmd: u32 , writer: & mut UserSlicePtrWriter ) -> KernelResult< i32 > { match cmd { IOCTL_GET_READ_COUNT => { writer.write( & self .read_count .load(Ordering::Relaxed))?; Ok ( 0 ) } _ => Err (Error::EINVAL), } } fn write ( & self , _file: &File, cmd: u32 , reader: & mut UserSlicePtrReader ) -> KernelResult< i32 > { match cmd { IOCTL_SET_READ_COUNT => { self .read_count .store(reader.read()?, Ordering::Relaxed); Ok ( 0 ) } _ => Err (Error::EINVAL), } } } static long semaphore_ioctl ( struct file *filp, unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg) { struct file_state *state = filp->private_data; void __user *buffer = ( void __user *)arg; u64 value; switch (cmd) { case IOCTL_GET_READ_COUNT: value = atomic64_read(&state->read_count); if (copy_to_user(buffer, &value, sizeof (value))) return -EFAULT; return 0 ; case IOCTL_SET_READ_COUNT: if (copy_from_user(&value, buffer, sizeof (value))) return -EFAULT; atomic64_set(&state->read_count, value); return 0 ; default : return -EINVAL; } }

Ioctl commands are standardized such that, given a command, we know whether a user buffer is provided, its intended use (read, write, both, none), and its size. In Rust, we provide a dispatcher (accessible by calling cmd.dispatch) that uses this information to automatically create user memory access helpers and pass them to the caller.

A driver is not required to use this though. If, for example, it doesn't use the standard ioctl encoding, Rust offers the flexibility of simply calling cmd.raw to extract the raw arguments and using them to handle the ioctl (potentially with unsafe code, which will need to be justified).

However, if a driver implementation does use the standard dispatcher, it will benefit from not having to implement any unsafe code, and:

The pointer to user memory is never a native pointer, so the developer cannot accidentally dereference it.

The types that allow the driver to read from user space only allow data to be read once, so we eliminate the risk of time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) bugs because when a driver needs to access data twice, it needs to copy it to kernel memory, where an attacker is not allowed to modify it. Excluding unsafe blocks, there is no way to introduce this class of bugs in Rust.

No accidental overflow of the user buffer: we'll never read or write past the end of the user buffer because this is enforced automatically based on the size encoded in the ioctl command. In our example above, the implementation of IOCTL_GET_READ_COUNT only has access to an instance of UserSlicePtrWriter , which limits the number of writable bytes to sizeof(u64) as encoded in the ioctl command.

only has access to an instance of , which limits the number of writable bytes to as encoded in the ioctl command. No mixing of reads and writes: we'll never write buffers for ioctls that are only meant to read and never read buffers for ioctls that are only meant to write. This is enforced by read and write handlers only getting instances of UserSlicePtrWriter and UserSlicePtrReader respectively.

All of the above could potentially also be done in C, but it's very easy for developers to (likely unintentionally) break contracts that lead to unsafety; Rust requires unsafe blocks for this, which should only be used in rare cases and brings additional scrutiny. Additionally, Rust offers the following:

The types used to read and write user memory do not implement the Send Sync

When calling IoctlCommand::dispatch , one might understandably think that we need dynamic dispatching to reach the actual handler implementation (which would incur additional cost in comparison to C), but we don't. Our usage of generics will lead the compiler to monomorphize the function, which will result in static function calls that can even be inlined if the optimizer so chooses.

Locking and condition variables

We allow developers to use mutexes and spinlocks to provide interior mutability. In our example, we use a mutex to protect mutable data; in the tables below we show the data structures we use in C and Rust, and how we implement a wait until the count is nonzero so that we can satisfy a read:

struct SemaphoreInner { count: usize , max_seen: usize , } struct Semaphore { changed: CondVar, inner: Mutex<SemaphoreInner>, } struct FileState { read_count: AtomicU64, shared: Arc<Semaphore>, } struct semaphore_state { struct kref ref; struct miscdevice miscdev; wait_queue_head_t changed; struct mutex mutex; size_t count; size_t max_seen; }; struct file_state { atomic64_t read_count; struct semaphore_state *shared; };

fn consume (& self ) -> KernelResult { let mut inner = self .shared.inner.lock(); while inner.count == 0 { if self .shared.changed.wait(& mut inner) { return Err (Error::EINTR); } } inner.count -= 1 ; Ok (()) } static int semaphore_consume ( struct semaphore_state *state) { DEFINE_WAIT(wait); mutex_lock(&state->mutex); while (state->count == 0 ) { prepare_to_wait(&state->changed, &wait, TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE); mutex_unlock(&state->mutex); schedule(); finish_wait(&state->changed, &wait); if (signal_pending(current)) return -EINTR; mutex_lock(&state->mutex); } state->count--; mutex_unlock(&state->mutex); return 0 ; }

We note that such waits are not uncommon in the existing C code, for example, a pipe waiting for a ""partner"" to write, a unix-domain socket waiting for data, an inode search waiting for completion of a delete, or a user-mode helper waiting for state change.

The following are benefits from the Rust implementation:

The Semaphore::inner field is only accessible when the lock is held, through the guard returned by the lock function. So developers cannot accidentally read or write protected data without locking it first. In the C example above, count and max_seen in semaphore_state are protected by mutex , but there is no enforcement that the lock is held while they're accessed.

In the C example above, and in are protected by , but there is no enforcement that the lock is held while they're accessed. Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII): the lock is unlocked automatically when the guard ( inner in this case) goes out of scope. This ensures that locks are always unlocked: if the developer needs to keep a lock locked, they can keep the guard alive, for example, by returning the guard itself; conversely, if they need to unlock before the end of the scope, they can explicitly do it by calling the drop function.

This ensures that locks are always unlocked: if the developer needs to keep a lock locked, they can keep the guard alive, for example, by returning the guard itself; conversely, if they need to unlock before the end of the scope, they can explicitly do it by calling the function. Developers can use any lock that implements the Lock trait, which includes Mutex and SpinLock , at no additional runtime cost when compared to a C implementation. Other synchronization constructs, including condition variables, also work transparently and with zero additional run-time cost.

trait, which includes and , at no additional runtime cost when compared to a C implementation. Other synchronization constructs, including condition variables, also work transparently and with zero additional run-time cost. Rust implements condition variables using kernel wait queues. This allows developers to benefit from atomic release of the lock and putting the thread to sleep without having to reason about low-level kernel scheduler functions. In the C example above, semaphore_consume is a mix of semaphore logic and subtle Linux scheduling: for example, the code is incorrect if mutex_unlock is called before prepare_to_wait because it may result in a wake up being missed.

is a mix of semaphore logic and subtle Linux scheduling: for example, the code is incorrect if is called before because it may result in a wake up being missed. No unsynchronized access: as we mentioned before, variables shared by multiple threads/CPUs must be read-only, with interior mutability being the solution for cases when mutability is needed. In addition to the example with locks above, the ioctl example in the previous section also has an example of using an atomic variable; Rust also requires developers to specify how memory is to be synchronized by atomic accesses. In the C part of the example, we happen to use atomic64_t , but the compiler won't alert a developer to this need.

Error handling and control flow

In the tables below, we show how open, read, and write are implemented in our example driver:

fn read ( & self , _: &File, data: & mut UserSlicePtrWriter, offset: u64 ) -> KernelResult< usize > { if data.is_empty() || offset > 0 { return Ok ( 0 ); } self .consume()?; data.write_slice(&[ 0u8 ; 1 ])?; self .read_count.fetch_add( 1 , Ordering::Relaxed); Ok ( 1 ) } static ssize_t semaphore_read ( struct file *filp, char __user *buffer, size_t count, loff_t *ppos) { struct file_state *state = filp->private_data; char c = 0 ; int ret; if (count == 0 || *ppos > 0 ) return 0 ; ret = semaphore_consume(state->shared); if (ret) return ret; if (copy_to_user(buffer, &c, sizeof (c))) return -EFAULT; atomic64_add( 1 , &state->read_count); *ppos += 1 ; return 1 ; }

fn write ( & self , data: & mut UserSlicePtrReader, _offset: u64 ) -> KernelResult< usize > { { let mut inner = self .shared.inner.lock(); inner.count = inner.count.saturating_add(data.len()); if inner.count > inner.max_seen { inner.max_seen = inner.count; } } self .shared.changed.notify_all(); Ok (data.len()) } static ssize_t semaphore_write ( struct file *filp, const char __user *buffer, size_t count, loff_t *ppos) { struct file_state *state = filp->private_data; struct semaphore_state *shared = state->shared; mutex_lock(&shared->mutex); shared->count += count; if (shared->count < count) shared->count = SIZE_MAX; if (shared->count > shared->max_seen) shared->max_seen = shared->count; mutex_unlock(&shared->mutex); wake_up_all(&shared->changed); return count; }

fn open ( shared: &Arc<Semaphore> ) -> KernelResult< Box < Self >> { Ok ( Box ::try_new( Self { read_count: AtomicU64::new( 0 ), shared: shared.clone(), })?) } static int semaphore_open ( struct inode *nodp, struct file *filp) { struct semaphore_state *shared = container_of(filp->private_data, struct semaphore_state, miscdev); struct file_state *state; state = kzalloc( sizeof (*state), GFP_KERNEL); if (!state) return -ENOMEM; kref_get(&shared->ref); state->shared = shared; atomic64_set(&state->read_count, 0 ); filp->private_data = state; return 0 ; }

They illustrate other benefits brought by Rust:

The ? operator: it is used by the Rust open and read implementations to do error handling implicitly; the developer can focus on the semaphore logic, the resulting code being quite small and readable. The C versions have error-handling noise that can make them less readable.

operator: it is used by the Rust and implementations to do error handling implicitly; the developer can focus on the semaphore logic, the resulting code being quite small and readable. The C versions have error-handling noise that can make them less readable. Required initialization: Rust requires all fields of a struct to be initialized on construction, so the developer can never accidentally fail to initialize a field; C offers no such facility. In our open example above, the developer of the C version could easily fail to call kref_get (even though all fields would have been initialized); in Rust, the user is required to call clone (which increments the ref count), otherwise they get a compilation error.

example above, the developer of the C version could easily fail to call (even though all fields would have been initialized); in Rust, the user is required to call (which increments the ref count), otherwise they get a compilation error. RAII scoping: the Rust write implementation uses a statement block to control when inner goes out of scope and therefore the lock is released.

goes out of scope and therefore the lock is released. Integer overflow behavior: Rust encourages developers to always consider how overflows should be handled. In our write example, we want a saturating one so that we don't end up with a zero value when adding to our semaphore. In C, we need to manually check for overflows, there is no additional support from the compiler.

What's next

The examples above are only a small part of the whole project. We hope it gives readers a glimpse of the kinds of benefits that Rust brings. At the moment we have nearly all generic kernel functionality needed by Binder neatly wrapped in safe Rust abstractions, so we are in the process of gathering feedback from the broader Linux kernel community with the intent of upstreaming the existing Rust support.

We also continue to make progress on our Binder prototype, implement additional abstractions, and smooth out some rough edges. This is an exciting time and a rare opportunity to potentially influence how the Linux kernel is developed, as well as inform the evolution of the Rust language. We invite those interested to join us in Rust for Linux and attend our planned talk at Linux Plumbers Conference 2021!

In comparison, the Rust compiler assists in avoiding stray mutability annotations by offering warnings for mutable values which are never mutated.","Correctness of code in the Android platform is a top priority for the security, stability, and quality of each Android release. Memory safety bugs in C and C++ continue to be the most-difficult-to-address source of incorrectness. We invest a great deal of effort and resources into detecting, fixing, and mitigating this class of bugs, and these efforts are effective in preventing a large number of bugs from making it into Android releases. Yet in spite of these efforts, memory safety bugs continue to be a top contributor of stability issues, and consistently represent ~70% of Android’s high severity security vulnerabilities.

In addition to ongoing and upcoming efforts to improve detection of memory bugs, we are ramping up efforts to prevent them in the first place. Memory-safe languages are the most cost-effective means for preventing memory bugs. In addition to memory-safe languages like Kotlin and Java, we’re excited to announce that the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) now supports the Rust programming language for developing the OS itself.

Systems programming

Managed languages like Java and Kotlin are the best option for Android app development. These languages are designed for ease of use, portability, and safety. The Android Runtime (ART) manages memory on behalf of the developer. The Android OS uses Java extensively, effectively protecting large portions of the Android platform from memory bugs. Unfortunately, for the lower layers of the OS, Java and Kotlin are not an option.



Lower levels of the OS require systems programming languages like C, C++, and Rust. These languages are designed with control and predictability as goals. They provide access to low level system resources and hardware. They are light on resources and have more predictable performance characteristics.



For C and C++, the developer is responsible for managing memory lifetime. Unfortunately, it's easy to make mistakes when doing this, especially in complex and multithreaded codebases.



Rust provides memory safety guarantees by using a combination of compile-time checks to enforce object lifetime/ownership and runtime checks to ensure that memory accesses are valid. This safety is achieved while providing equivalent performance to C and C++.

The limits of sandboxing

C and C++ languages don’t provide these same safety guarantees and require robust isolation. All Android processes are sandboxed and we follow the Rule of 2 to decide if functionality necessitates additional isolation and deprivileging. The Rule of 2 is simple: given three options, developers may only select two of the following three options.

For Android, this means that if code is written in C/C++ and parses untrustworthy input, it should be contained within a tightly constrained and unprivileged sandbox. While adherence to the Rule of 2 has been effective in reducing the severity and reachability of security vulnerabilities, it does come with limitations. Sandboxing is expensive: the new processes it requires consume additional overhead and introduce latency due to IPC and additional memory usage. Sandboxing doesn’t eliminate vulnerabilities from the code and its efficacy is reduced by high bug density, allowing attackers to chain multiple vulnerabilities together.

Memory-safe languages like Rust help us overcome these limitations in two ways:

Lowers the density of bugs within our code, which increases the effectiveness of our current sandboxing. Reduces our sandboxing needs, allowing introduction of new features that are both safer and lighter on resources.

But what about all that existing C++?

Of course, introducing a new programming language does nothing to address bugs in our existing C/C++ code. Even if we redirected the efforts of every software engineer on the Android team, rewriting tens of millions of lines of code is simply not feasible.

The above analysis of the age of memory safety bugs in Android (measured from when they were first introduced) demonstrates why our memory-safe language efforts are best focused on new development and not on rewriting mature C/C++ code. Most of our memory bugs occur in new or recently modified code, with about 50% being less than a year old.

The comparative rarity of older memory bugs may come as a surprise to some, but we’ve found that old code is not where we most urgently need improvement. Software bugs are found and fixed over time, so we would expect the number of bugs in code that is being maintained but not actively developed to go down over time. Just as reducing the number and density of bugs improves the effectiveness of sandboxing, it also improves the effectiveness of bug detection.

Limitations of detection

Bug detection via robust testing, sanitization, and fuzzing is crucial for improving the quality and correctness of all software, including software written in Rust. A key limitation for the most effective memory safety detection techniques is that the erroneous state must actually be triggered in instrumented code in order to be detected. Even in code bases with excellent test/fuzz coverage, this results in a lot of bugs going undetected.

Another limitation is that bug detection is scaling faster than bug fixing. In some projects, bugs that are being detected are not always getting fixed. Bug fixing is a long and costly process.

Each of these steps is costly, and missing any one of them can result in the bug going unpatched for some or all users. For complex C/C++ code bases, often there are only a handful of people capable of developing and reviewing the fix, and even with a high amount of effort spent on fixing bugs, sometimes the fixes are incorrect.

Bug detection is most effective when bugs are relatively rare and dangerous bugs can be given the urgency and priority that they merit. Our ability to reap the benefits of improvements in bug detection require that we prioritize preventing the introduction of new bugs.

Prioritizing prevention

Rust modernizes a range of other language aspects, which results in improved correctness of code:

The two unpatched issues, tracked under the identifiers CVE-2021-39276 (CVSS score: 5.3) and CVE-2021-39277 (CVSS score: 5.7), were discovered and reported by cybersecurity firm Rapid7 in May 2021 with a 60-day deadline to fix the weaknesses.

The Fortress S03 Wi-Fi Home Security System is a do-it-yourself (DIY) alarm system that enables users to secure their homes and small businesses from burglars, fires, gas leaks, and water leaks by leveraging Wi-Fi and RFID technology for keyless entry. The company's security and surveillance systems are used by ""thousands of clients and continued customers,"" according to its website.

Calling the vulnerabilities ""trivially easy to exploit,"" Rapid7 researchers noted CVE-2021-39276 concerns an unauthenticated API Access that enables an attacker in possession of a victim's email address to query the API to leak the device's International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number, which also doubles up as the serial number. Armed with the device's IMEI number and the email address, the adversary can proceed to make a number of unauthorized changes, such as disabling the alarm system via an unauthenticated POST request.

CVE-2021-39277, on the other hand, relates to an RF Signal replay attack, wherein a lack of adequate encryption grants the bad actor the ability to capture the radio frequency command and control communications over the air using software-defined radio (SDR), and playback the transmission to perform specific functions, such as ""arm"" and ""disarm"" operations, on the target device.

""For CVE-2021-39276, an attacker with the knowledge of a Fortress S03 user's email address can easily disarm the installed home alarm without that user's knowledge,"" the researchers said in a report shared with The Hacker News.

""CVE-2021-39277 presents similar problems, but requires less prior knowledge of the victim, as the attacker can simply stake out the property and wait for the victim to use the RF-controlled devices within radio range. The attacker can then replay the 'disarm' command later, without the victim's knowledge.""

In light of the fact that the issues continue to persist, it's recommended that users configure their alarm systems with a unique, one-time email address to work around the IMEI number exposure.

""For CVE-2021-39277, there seems to be very little a user can do to mitigate the effects of the RF replay issues absent a firmware update to enforce cryptographic controls on RF signals.

Called ""Verification of Interaction Authenticity"" (aka VIA), the recurring authentication scheme aims to solve the problem of passive, continuous authentication and automatic deauthentication once two devices are paired with one another, which remain authenticated until an explicit deauthentication action is taken, or the authenticated session expires.

""Consider devices that pair via Bluetooth, which commonly follow the pattern of pair once, trust indefinitely. After two devices connect, those devices are bonded until a user explicitly removes the bond. This bond is likely to remain intact as long as the devices exist, or until they transfer ownership,"" Travis Peters, one of the co-authors of the study, said.

""The increased adoption of (Bluetooth-enabled) IoT devices and reports of the inadequacy of their security makes indefinite trust of devices problematic. The reality of ubiquitous connectivity and frequent mobility gives rise to a myriad of opportunities for devices to be compromised,"" Peters added.

Authentication is a process to verify that an individual or a system is, in fact, who or what it claims to be. While authentication can also be achieved by identification — something who you are — the latest research approaches it from a verification perspective in that it aims to validate that apps and devices interact in a manner that's consistent with their prior observations. In other words, the device's interaction patterns act as a barometer of its overall behavior.

To this end, the recurring validation of interaction patterns allows for authenticating the device by cross-checking the device's behavior against a previously learned machine learning model that represents typical, trustworthy interactions, with the first authentication factor being the use of traditional Bluetooth identifiers and credentials.

""For example, a user that has a blood-pressure device may really only care if a blood-pressure monitor device is 'hooked up' to the measurement app, and is operating in a way that is consistent with how a blood-pressure monitor should operate,"" the researchers outlined.

""Presumably, so long as these properties hold, there is no immediate or obvious threat. If, however, a device connects as a blood-pressure monitor and then goes on to interact in a way that is inconsistent with typical interactions for this type of device, then there may be cause for concern.""

VIA works by extracting features from packet headers and payloads and comparing them to a verification model to corroborate whether the ongoing interactions are consistent with this known authentic behavioral model, and if so, permit the devices to continue communicating with each other. As a consequence, any deviation from authentic interactions will result in failed verification, allowing devices to take steps to mitigate any future threat.

The model is constructed using a combination of features, such as n-grams built from deep packet inspection, protocol identifiers and packet types, packet lengths, and packet directionality. The dataset consists of a collection of 300 Bluetooth HCI network traces that capture interactions between 20 distinct smart health and smart home devices and 13 different smartphone apps installed on a Nexus 5 smartphone running Android 6.0.1.

The issue, tracked as CVE-2021-33766 (CVSS score: 7.3) and coined ""ProxyToken,"" was discovered by Le Xuan Tuyen, a researcher at the Information Security Center of Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Group (VNPT-ISC), and reported through the Zero-Day Initiative (ZDI) program in March 2021.

""With this vulnerability, an unauthenticated attacker can perform configuration actions on mailboxes belonging to arbitrary users,"" the ZDI said Monday. ""As an illustration of the impact, this can be used to copy all emails addressed to a target and account and forward them to an account controlled by the attacker.""

Microsoft addressed the issue as part of its Patch Tuesday updates for July 2021.

The security shortcoming resides in a feature called Delegated Authentication, which refers to a mechanism whereby the front-end website — the Outlook web access (OWA) client — passes authentication requests directly to the back-end when it detects the presence of a SecurityToken cookie.

However, since Exchange has to be specifically configured to use the feature and have the back-end carry out the checks, it leads to a scenario in which the module handling this delegation (""DelegatedAuthModule"") isn't loaded under default configuration, culminating in a bypass as the back-end fails to authenticate incoming requests based on the SecurityToken cookie.

""The net result is that requests can sail through, without being subjected to authentication on either the front or back end,"" ZDI's Simon Zuckerbraun explained.

The disclosure adds to a growing list of Exchange Server vulnerabilities that have come to light this year, including ProxyLogon, ProxyOracle, and ProxyShell, which have been actively exploited by threat actors to take over unpatched servers, deploy malicious web shells and file-encrypting ransomware such as LockFile.

Email routing protocols were designed in a time when cryptographic technology was at a nascent stage (e.g., the de-facto protocol for email transfer, SMTP, is nearly 40 years old now), and therefore security was not an important consideration.

As a result, in most email systems encryption is still opportunistic, which implies that if the opposite connection does not support TLS, it gets rolled back to an unencrypted one delivering messages in plaintext.

To mitigate SMTP security problems, MTA-STS (Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security) is the recommended email authentication standard. It enforces TLS in order to allow MTAs to send emails securely. This means that it will only allow mail from MTAs that support TLS encryption, and it will only allow mail to go to MX hosts that support TLS encryption.

In case an encrypted connection cannot be negotiated between communicating SMTP servers, the email is not sent, instead of being sent over an unencrypted connection.

Analyzing the risks involved in transferring emails over an unencrypted SMTP connection

STARTTLS is a communication protocol extension to the SMTP email transfer protocol that allows both the communication partners to upgrade an unencrypted communication to encrypted communication. This backward-compatible security implementation was retrofitted into SMTP to ensure that all clients can connect with some level of encryption. When SMTP was first created in the 1980s, it didn't have any security measures to ensure the communication between mail servers was sent in an encrypted form—it just sent mail as plain text.

A known vulnerability in the protocol design of the SMTP can be exploited to downgrade a connection easily. Since SMTP was not designed to be encrypted, the upgrade for encrypted delivery is performed by sending an unencrypted STARTTLS command. This enables a Man-in-the-middle attacker to tamper with the STARTTLS command, thereby downgrading the TLS-encrypted connection to an unencrypted one. This forces the email client to fall back to sending information in plaintext. The attacker can then easily access and eavesdrop on the decrypted information.

Cyber Eavesdropping attacks like MITM can jeopardize sensitive information exchanged between officials of an organization, leading to the leakage of company databases and login credentials.

How to Ensure TLS Encryption with MTA-STS?

MTA-STS makes TLS encryption mandatory in SMTP, which ensures that messages are not sent over an unsecured connection, or delivered in plaintext. This in turn keeps Man-in-the-middle and DNS spoofing attacks at bay by stopping attackers from intercepting email communications.

PowerDMARC's hosted MTA-STS services help eliminate the complications that come with adopting the protocol, by making the overall process easy for domain owners.

Our hosted MTA-STS provides domain owners with the following benefits:

We host and manage the policy files and certificates on your behalf

Adopting the protocol is as easy as publishing a few DNS CNAME records, making it effortless and speedy

A dedicated dashboard to manage and modify the protocol configurations that enable you to make changes to your MTA-STS record without having to access your DNS

PowerDMARC's hosted MTA-STS services meet the RFC compliance requirements as well as the current TLS standards

What concerns domain owners after implementing MTA-STS is how to get alerted during situations where an encrypted connection cannot be negotiated and messages fail to get delivered. However, keeping this issue in mind experts curated SMTP TLS reporting, a mechanism that notifies you of delivery issues.

How to View and Manage Your TLS Reports?

TLS-RPT allows you to get notified of email delivery failure on TLS encrypted channels; it analyzes and reports all possible issues within those channels, allowing you to react to a TLS issue and deliver a message back without any delay. It is an excellent addition to MTA-STS as it addresses the concern pertaining to emails getting lost during transfer.

PowerDMARC's hosted TLS-RPT services:

Gives you access to a dedicated dashboard that automatically parses your TLS reports (originally sent in JSON format), to make them simple and human-readable

TLS-RPT data is organized into tables, with actionable buttons and icons for ease of use and navigation

Furthermore, your reports are assorted into two separate viewing formats: per sending source and per result, for better visibility and clarity, and an enhanced user experience.

PowerDMARC helps you deploy and manage email authentication solutions like DMARC, SPF, DKIM, BIMI, MTA-STS, and TLS-RPT, under a single roof without having to deploy them separately for your domain!

Called LockFile, the operators of the ransomware have been found exploiting recently disclosed flaws such as ProxyShell and PetitPotam to compromise Windows servers and deploy file-encrypting malware that scrambles only every alternate 16 bytes of a file, thereby giving it the ability to evade ransomware defences.

""Partial encryption is generally used by ransomware operators to speed up the encryption process and we've seen it implemented by BlackMatter, DarkSide and LockBit 2.0 ransomware,"" Mark Loman, Sophos director of engineering, said in a statement. ""What sets LockFile apart is that, unlike the others, it doesn't encrypt the first few blocks. Instead, LockFile encrypts every other 16 bytes of a document.""

""This means that a file such as a text document remains partially readable and looks statistically like the original. This trick can be successful against ransomware protection software that relies on inspecting content using statistical analysis to detect encryption,"" Loman added.

Sophos' analysis of LockFile comes from an artifact that was uploaded to VirusTotal on August 22, 2021.

Once deposited, the malware also takes steps to terminate critical processes associated with virtualization software and databases via the Windows Management Interface (WMI), before proceeding to encrypt critical files and objects, and display a ransomware note that bears stylistic similarities with that of LockBit 2.0.

The ransom note also urges the victim to contact a specific email address ""contact@contipauper.com,"" which Sophos suspects could be a derogatory reference to a competing ransomware group called Conti.

What's more, the ransomware deletes itself from the system post successful encryption of all the documents on the machine, meaning that ""there is no ransomware binary for incident responders or antivirus software to find or clean up.""

""The message here for defenders is that the cyberthreat landscape never stands still, and adversaries will quickly seize every possible opportunity or tool to launch a successful attack,"" Loman said.

The disclosure comes as the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released a Flash report detailing the tactics of a new Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) outfit known as Hive, consisting of a number of actors who are using multiple mechanisms to compromise business networks, exfiltrate data and encrypt data on the networks, and attempt to collect a ransom in exchange for access to the decryption software."

""Attackers combine these links with social engineering baits that impersonate well-known productivity tools and services to lure users into clicking,"" Microsoft 365 Defender Threat Intelligence Team said in a report published this week.

""Doing so leads to a series of redirections — including a CAPTCHA verification page that adds a sense of legitimacy and attempts to evade some automated analysis systems — before taking the user to a fake sign-in page. This ultimately leads to credential compromise, which opens the user and their organization to other attacks.""

Although redirect links in email messages serve a vital tool to take recipients to third-party websites or track click rates and measure the success of sales and marketing campaigns, the same technique can be abused by adversaries to redirect such links to their own infrastructure, at the same time keeping the trusted domain in the full URL intact to evade analysis by anti-malware engines, even when users attempt to hover on links to check for any signs of suspicious content.

In order to lead potential victims to phishing sites, the redirect URLs embedded in the message are set up using a legitimate service, while the final actor-controlled domains contained in the link leverage top-level domains .xyz, .club, .shop, and .online (e.g. ""c-tl[.]xyz""), but which are passed as parameters so as to sneak past email gateway solutions.

Microsoft said it observed at least 350 unique phishing domains as part of the campaign — another attempt to obscure detection — underscoring the campaign's effective use of convincing social engineering lures that purport to be notification messages from apps like Office 365 and Zoom, a well-crafted detection evasion technique, and a durable infrastructure to carry out the attacks.

""This not only shows the scale with which this attack is being conducted, but it also demonstrates how much the attackers are investing in it, indicating potentially significant payoffs,"" the researchers said.

To give the attack a veneer of authenticity, clicking the specially-crafted link redirects the users to a malicious landing page that employs Google reCAPTCHA to block any dynamic scanning attempts. Upon completion of the CAPTCHA verification, the victims are displayed a fraudulent login page mimicking a known service like Microsoft Office 365, only to swipe their passwords upon submitting the information.

The two weaknesses are part of a trio of vulnerabilities discovered and reported by researchers at the Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure (DIVD) on July 3, 2021.

The IT infrastructure management solution provider has addressed the issues in server software version 10.5.5-2 released on August 12, DIVD said. An as-yet-undisclosed client-side vulnerability in Kaseya Unitrends remains unpatched, but the company has published firewall rules that can be applied to filter traffic to and from the client and mitigate any risk associated with the flaw. As an additional precaution, it's recommended not to leave the servers accessible over the internet.

Although specifics related to the vulnerabilities are sparse, the shortcomings concern an authenticated remote code execution vulnerability as well as a privilege escalation flaw from read-only user to admin on Unitrends servers, both of which hinge on the possibility that an attacker has already gained an initial foothold on a target's network, making them more difficult to exploit.

The disclosure comes close to two months after the company suffered a crippling ransomware strike on its VSA on-premises product, leading to the mysterious shutdown of REvil cybercrime syndicate in the following weeks. Kaseya has since shipped fixes for the zero-days that were exploited to gain access to the on-premise servers, and late last month, said it obtained a universal decryptor ""to remediate customers impacted by the incident."""

The flaw, which grants read, write, and delete privileges, has been dubbed ""ChaosDB,"" with Wiz researchers noting that ""the vulnerability has a trivial exploit that doesn't require any previous access to the target environment, and impacts thousands of organizations, including numerous Fortune 500 companies.""

Cosmos DB is Microsoft's proprietary NoSQL database that's advertised as ""a fully managed service"" that ""takes database administration off your hands with automatic management, updates and patching.""

The Wiz Research Team reported the issue to Microsoft on August 12, after which the Windows maker took steps to mitigate the issue within 48 hours of responsible disclosure, in addition to awarding a $40,000 bounty to the finders on August 17.

""We have no indication that external entities outside the researcher had access to the primary read-write key associated with your Azure Cosmos DB account(s),"" Microsoft said in a statement. ""In addition, we are not aware of any data access because of this vulnerability. Azure Cosmos DB accounts with a vNET or firewall enabled are protected by additional security mechanisms that prevent risk of unauthorized access.""

The exploit identified by Wiz concerns a chain of vulnerabilities in the Jupyter Notebook feature of Cosmos DB, enabling an adversary to obtain the credentials corresponding to the target Cosmos DB account, including the Primary Key, which provides access to the administrative resources for the database account.

""Using these credentials, it is possible to view, modify, and delete data in the target Cosmos DB account via multiple channels,"" the researchers said. As a consequence, any Cosmos DB asset that has the Jupyter Notebook feature enabled is potentially impacted.

Though often overlooked, this vector is especially relevant today, as many corporate employees remain working from home.

In this post, I contrast in-home local propagation with traditional vectors through which a threat (ransomware in particular) spreads throughout an organization. I discuss the reasons this type of spread is problematic for employees and corporations alike. Finally, I offer simple solutions to mitigate the risk of such tactics.

Why Should IT and Security Stakeholders Care?

Today's long cycle attacks are often reconnoitering the victim environment for weeks, if not months. In this time, the attacker gains a tremendous amount of knowledge about systems in the victim's footprint. This additional loiter time in the victim's environment, coupled with ad-hoc maintained work-from-home environments, presents both an ingress avenue for attacks into their network as well as an egress avenue for attack out of your network into your employees' personal devices.

Contrasting Tactics

Traditional Spread — For some time in 2020, even with a shift to WFH, ransomware continued to propagate through some of the same vectors it had previously. Spread was common through email, malicious websites, server vulnerabilities, private cloud, and file shares. Often this was sufficient to get the attacker to saturate in the victim's environment. However, prior to our WFH lifestyle, when it came to cross-organizational spread, many of these vectors were largely inapplicable. This leads to a natural containment of an infection to a single organization.

In-home Local Propagation — Recently, attackers have been jumping zones from their initial corporate victims into adjacent systems, including other endpoints in a victim's home. It isn't 100% clear if this is due to a natural extension of the reconnaissance they are doing as a part of their double-extortion ransom endeavors (where a ransom is demanded to decrypt files and a second ransom is demanded not to leak stolen files), or if this is because they are cluing into the fact that additional victims are meters away.

This jump to physically local systems can be made via traditional propagation vectors, such as open file shares, via local (to the home network) exploitation of vulnerabilities, or via the access points (APs) themselves. Home APs / Routers are often:

Consumer-grade

Poorly configured (often with standard/default admin passwords)

Lacking encryption or any security measures between devices

And, you can forget about detection and response, as no logs from these devices will be making it back to anybody's SIEM, SOC, nor MDR service provider.

This leaves an opportunity for threat actors to spread via in-home local propagation.

There are a couple of distinct advantages for them doing so.

Infection of employees' personal devices:

While this could mean another party to potentially fork-over the ransom payment (the employee), the real value in spreading to an employee's personal device is leverage to force or influence the corporate payment. Imagine for a moment that the employee in question is the IT Director, and by encouraging their leadership team to pay the ransom to restore business continuity, that they also believe they could get their family photo album, gaming machine, or spouse's work laptop decrypted.

Infection of third-party corporate devices

As described above previously, the ways to jump to separate corporate environments were either limited or well-defended. But, with employees across different companies cohabitating (spouses, roommates) or sharing internet access (neighbors) - the next potential corporate victim is just a stepping stone away, likely via a poorly-configured AP/Router at that.

Consequences

In-home local propagation represents a greater liability for companies facing a ransomware attack, as the victims span corporate and organizational boundaries.

Furthermore, the ability to mitigate risk is limited, as they are unlikely to have direct control over the network infrastructure of employees working from home. In fact, this separation is vehemently defended by employees themselves, citing privacy concerns - another potential liability for you.

Remediative Steps

To mitigate the risk of in-home local propagation of ransomware (or other nasty malware, for that matter), IT and security teams can consider the following steps:

Encourage a robust configuration of employee-owned networking devices

Ensure a sound remote software update capability, to keep client endpoint hygiene at a decent level.

Identify and remediate vulnerabilities across client endpoints

Engage in detection and response (threat hunting) activities across your endpoints and environment.

There's a new war in the office. As companies nudge their staff to return to communal workspaces, many workers don't actually want to – more than 50 percent of employees would rather quit, according to research by EY.

While HR teams worry over the hearts and minds of staff, IT security professionals have a different battle plan to draft – how to make the new normal of the hybrid workplace secure.

The Trade-off Between Usability and Security

A company's biggest vulnerability continues to be its people. In a hybrid workplace, a Zero Trust strategy means ever-tightening security. The MFA a company chooses affects the difficulty of logging into email, dashboards, workflow tools, client documentation, and so on. Or, conversely, how porous access security is.

Now imagine this scenario. An employee opens a company portal, confirms a prompt on a company app on her phone, and that's it. She has been authenticated seamlessly by a strong possession factor using her company registered mobile number against the SIM. Nothing to remember, nothing to forget, no tokens, and no codes to type against a countdown.

'End Points' Are Human

In order to implement a Zero Trust policy that's both effective and accessible, it's time to stop thinking of employees as 'end points', and address the human habits in security. For example, a Twitter poll by tru.ID revealed that 40% of people use a 'mental system' for passwords.

These mental systems are in a race between complexity and memory. Passwords now need to be long, complicated, and nonsensical – and even those still get breached, thanks to database leaks or phishing scams. This just isn't sustainable.

Inherence factors such as biometrics still involve friction to set up and use. As we know from the face or fingerprint recognition on our phones, biometrics don't always work first-time and still require a passcode failover. Plus, not all levels of access require such stringent security.

Possession Factor using Mobile Network Authentication

On the spectrum between passwords and biometrics lies the possession factor – most commonly the mobile phone. That's how SMS OTP and authenticator apps came about, but these come with fraud risk, usability issues, and are no longer the best solution.

The simpler, stronger solution to verification has been with us all along – using the strong security of the SIM card that is in every mobile phone. Mobile networks authenticate customers all the time to allow calls and data. The SIM card uses advanced cryptographic security, and is an established form of real-time verification that doesn't need any separate apps or hardware tokens.

However, the real magic of SIM-based authentication is that it requires no user action. It's there already.

Now, APIs by tru.ID open up SIM-based network authentication for developers to build frictionless, yet secure verification experiences.

Any concerns over privacy are alleviated by the fact that tru.ID does not process personally identifiable information between the network and the APIs. It's purely a URL-based lookup.

Passwordless Login: Zero User Effort and Zero Trust Security

One of the ways to use tru.ID APIs is to build a passwordless solution for remote login using a companion app to access an enterprise system. By implementing a one-tap interaction on a mobile phone, businesses can remove user friction from step-up security, and the risk of human error.

Here's an example workflow for an enterprise login companion app using tru.ID APIs:

Preface: user has the official company app installed on their phone. The enterprise app has tru.ID verification APIs embedded.

User attempts to login to a company system (email, data dashboard etc.). This can be on desktop or mobile. The system identifies the user attempting to login and sends a Push Notification. The mobile device and the company app receive the Push Notification, and the user is prompted to Confirm or Reject the login attempt. If it is them that's logging in, they will approve. When the user approves, a request is made to the tru.ID API via a backend to create a Check URL for that user's registered phone number. The company app will then request that Check URL over the mobile data connection using a tru.ID SDK. This is the stage when the mobile network operator and tru.ID verify that the phone number for the current device matches the phone number the user has registered on the login system. Note that no PII is exchanged. This is purely a URL-based lookup. Once the request has completed, the system will be informed by tru.ID whether the Check URL request and phone number match was successful. This is achieved via a webhook. If the phone number verification was successful, the user is logged in.

Although there are a number of steps in this approach, it's important to note that the user only has one action: to Confirm or Reject the login.

Credentials, or sometimes just referred to as 'Secrets,' are pieces of user or system-level confidential information that ought to be carefully protected and accessible to legitimate users only. We all know how important it is to keep these assets secure to prevent account misuse and breaches.

A reality check: How often do you make proactive efforts to protect these assets? Rarely, I'd say.

Among the worst mistakes a developer can make when it comes to application security is to accidentally commit confidential information publicly on the Internet. Surprisingly, secrets and credentials are accidentally leaked more often than you might expect, and there are intelligent tools that scan public repositories in search of committed secrets.

With the mission of empowering developers to take control of their own code integrity, SonarLint, a free and open source IDE extension from SonarSource, recently announced a new feature for its software that aims to help developers identify and prevent leaks of AWS user or system-level authentication credentials before they are committed to a repository and leaked from user's local source code or files.

Does this sound interesting to you? Continue reading to find out more.

First – why you should care

Let's take a moment to look back a little and see why this new SonarLint feature would be so important and useful to any developer.

Somewhere in your life, you might have used a credit card for online purchase and immediately received a call from the credit card company asking if you intended to go ahead with the purchase. If you did, no problem, all's well. If not, fraudulent activity was just caught before the transaction was complete – saving you and your credit card company the complexity of an after-the-fact compromised account.

The same applies to code development.

There may be a recurring connection to a cloud-based database as part of the code development and delivery process, or you may need credentials to access an API of a third-party company.

In that process, there is a chance you hard-coded credentials temporarily to ease use, or a colleague may have added confidential information for a quick local test, and then accidentally committed those files to a public repository. And...those temporary changes are now permanent....Yikes! Even with after-the-fact deletion of the code, there is still the chance that someone made a copy of your secret before the cleanup.

Next thing you know, someone has compromised the account, or worse yet, this small security lapse has provided someone with a small staging point for a larger infrastructure breach.

Breaches of this type are more common and potentially catastrophic than you might realize. There have been a number of news articles in the past year highlighting incidents where malicious users have stolen API keys embedded in public source code repositories such as GitHub and BitBucket. StackOverflow, Uber and more recently Shopify are examples of high-profile security incidents where secrets sprinkled in publicly visible files created havoc. Imagine the damage it could have done to the brand reputation.

Human error will continue to occur, but by performing the right checks at the right time, the error can be prevented from occurring in the first place. The previous case illustrates how exposure of 'secrets' detected at the relevant point of introduction, e.g. during programming or just before committing your code, could have saved a great deal of trouble.

The best place to detect and address these issues in your development workflow is at the very beginning of it, that is, in your IDE, Integrated development environment. There are a lot of large companies that have learned this lesson the hard way.

Advanced rules that detect AWS secrets in-IDE

With the recent addition of new rules for detecting cloud secrets, SonarLint protects AWS authentication credentials and Amazon Marketplace Web Service (MWS) credentials from leaking publicly. Check out the rules that safeguard MWS auth tokens, AWS Access Key, Key ID, and Session tokens.

SonarLint protects your credentials against public leakage by acting as your first line of defence. By flagging issues at the point of introduction (i.e., shifting issue detection further left), you can take immediate action and prevent the leak in the first place.

This is important because compromised accounts can have not only individual or resource-level ramifications, such as the possibility of account hacking, but also adverse consequences for the confidentiality of your customers. For example, compromised MWS tokens can be used to get illicit access to databases that contain customer information such as credit card numbers, email, shipping addresses, and merchant sales records.

With SonarLint installed in your IDE, these 'Secret' detection rules will enable you to catch the presence of such credentials at the first point of entry i.e., in the source code or in language-agnostic files (e.g., xml, yaml, json) before they are committed to the repo.

Besides identifying such problems, SonarLint is also able to provide clear guidance on how to resolve them. You then have full flexibility to take action and address the code being flagged; bringing you one step closer to delivering secure code.

Getting started in your IDE

This feature is currently supported in popular IDEs such as VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, CLion, WebStorm, PHPStorm, and Rider, with Visual Studio, Eclipse, and more to follow.

To start securing your code base you can download SonarLint for VS Code or SonarLint for your JetBrains IDEs. Or if you were already using SonarLint in your IDE, you can simply update the plugin to the newest version to enable this feature.

As a next step, the company also plans to extend the 'Secrets' detection functionality to other public cloud providers. In the future, you can expect SonarLint to support more cloud providers, SaaS products, and database providers.

Developers who use other SonarSource solutions – SonarQube or SonarCloud for delivering quality and secure code can extend their code security experience to their IDE. By installing SonarLint for free, not only can they immediately benefit from powerful features such as secret detection but also improve the overall code quality and security of their code base by sharing rules and analysis settings from SonarQube or SonarCloud to SonarLint to coalesce the entire development team on a single definition of code health."

The previously undocumented malware has been dubbed ""Sardonic"" by Romanian cybersecurity technology company Bitdefender, which it encountered during a forensic investigation in the wake of an unsuccessful attack carried out by FIN8 aimed at an unnamed financial institution located in the U.S.

Said to be under active development, ""Sardonic backdoor is extremely potent and has a wide range of capabilities that help the threat actor leverage new malware on the fly without updating components,"" Bitdefender researchers Eduard Budaca and Victor Vrabie said in a report shared with The Hacker News.

Since emerging on the scene in January 2016, FIN8 has leveraged a multitude of techniques, including spear-phishing and malicious software such as PUNCHTRACK and BADHATCH to steal payment card data from point-of-sale (POS) systems.

The threat group, which is known for taking extended breaks in between campaigns to fine-tune its tactics and increase the success rate of its operations, conducts cyber incursions primarily through ""living off the land"" attacks, using built-in tools and interfaces like PowerShell as well as taking advantage of legitimate services like sslip.io to disguise their activity.

Earlier this March, Bitdefender revealed FIN8's return after a year-and-a-half hiatus to target insurance, retail, technology, and chemical industries in the U.S., Canada, South Africa, Puerto Rico, Panama, and Italy with a revamped version of the BADHATCH implant featuring upgraded capabilities, including screen capturing, proxy tunneling, credential theft, and fileless execution.

In the latest incident analyzed by the firm, the attackers are said to have infiltrated the target network to conduct detailed reconnaissance, before carrying out lateral movement and privilege escalation activities to deploy the malware payload. ""There were multiple attempts to deploy the Sardonic backdoor on domain controllers in order to continue with privilege escalation and lateral movement, but the malicious command lines were blocked,"" the researchers said.

Written in C++, Sardonic not only takes steps to establish persistence on the compromised machine, but also comes equipped with capabilities that allow it to obtain system information, execute arbitrary commands, and load and execute additional plugins, the results of which are transmitted to a remote attacker-controlled server.

The devices run on a software component called SpaceCom, an embedded Linux system that runs either on the pump from within its smart battery pack or from inside the SpaceStation.

In a nutshell, the flaws identified by McAfee enables an attacker to escalate privileges, view sensitive information, upload arbitrary files, and perform remote code execution —

CVE-2021-33885 – Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity (CVSS 9.7)

– Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CVSS 7.1) CVE-2021-33884 – Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type (CVSS 5.8)

By chaining together the vulnerabilities, an adversary could ""modify a pump's configuration while the pump is in standby mode, resulting in an unexpected dose of medication being delivered to a patient on its next use – all with zero authentication,"" McAfee Advanced Threat Research team noted in a technical deep-dive.

Put differently, the weaknesses, which arise due to a lack of verification in the pump's operating system, could allow any attacker to send commands or data to it, thereby facilitating remote attacks that not only go undetected but also weaponize the device by altering the amount of medication a patient is expected to receive through infusion.

One caveat of note is that the attacks can only be successful when a pump is idle or in standby mode in between infusions, not to mention such unauthorized modifications to critical pump data necessitate that the threat actor first gain an initial foothold to the local network, or potentially carry out the intrusions over the internet in the event the pumps are directly exposed — a scenario that's unlikely.

""All facilities utilizing SpaceCom, Battery Pack SP with WiFi, and DataModule compactplus should review their IT infrastructure to ensure that a network zone concept has been implemented whereby critical systems, such as infusion pumps, are housed in separate (e.g., by firewalls or VLAN) environments which are not accessible directly from the internet or by unauthorized users,"" B.

""SideWalk is a previously undocumented backdoor used by the SparklingGoblin APT group.","A computer retail company based in the U.S. was the target of a previously undiscovered implant called SideWalk as part of a recent campaign undertaken by a Chinese advanced persistent threat group primarily known for singling out entities in East and Southeast Asia.

Slovak cybersecurity firm ESET attributed the malware to an advanced persistent threat it tracks under the moniker SparklingGoblin, an adversary believed to be connected to the Winnti umbrella group, noting its similarities to another backdoor dubbed Crosswalk that was put to use by the same threat actor in 2019.

""SideWalk is a modular backdoor that can dynamically load additional modules sent from its C&C [command-and-control] server, makes use of Google Docs as a dead drop resolver, and Cloudflare workers as a C&C server,"" ESET researchers Thibaut Passilly and Mathieu Tartare said in a report published Tuesday. ""It can also properly handle communication behind a proxy.""

Since first emerging on the threat landscape in 2019, SparklingGoblin has been linked to several attacks aimed at Hong Kong universities using backdoors such as Spyder and ShadowPad, the latter of which has become a preferred malware of choice among multiple Chinese threat clusters in recent years.

Over the past year, the collective has hit a broad range of organizations and verticals around the world, with a particular focus on the academic institutions located in Bahrain, Canada, Georgia, India, Macao, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and the U.S. Other targeted entities include media companies, religious organizations, e-commerce platforms, computer and electronics manufacturers, and local governments.

SideWalk is characterized as an encrypted shellcode, which is deployed via a .NET loader that takes care of ""reading the encrypted shellcode from disk, decrypting it and injecting it into a legitimate process using the process hollowing technique."" The next phase of the infection commences with SideWalk establishing communications with the C&C server, with the malware retrieving the encrypted IP address from a Google Docs document.

""The decrypted IP address is 80.85.155[.]80. That C&C server uses a self-signed certificate for the facebookint[.]com domain. This domain has been attributed to BARIUM by Microsoft, which partially overlaps with what we define as Winnti Group. As this IP address is not the first one to be used by the malware, it is considered to be the fallback one,"" the researchers said.

Besides using HTTPS protocol for C&C communications, SideWalk is designed to load arbitrary plugins sent from the server, amass information about running processes, and exfiltrate the results back to the remote server.

""SideWalk is a previously undocumented backdoor used by the SparklingGoblin APT group. It was most likely produced by the same developers as those behind CROSSWALK, with which it shares many design structures and implementation details,"" the researchers concluded."

Modified versions of legitimate Android apps — a practice called Modding — are designed to perform functions not originally conceived or intended by the app developers. FMWhatsApp, billed as a custom build of WhatsApp, allows users to refashion the app with different themes, personalize icons, and hide features like last seen, and even deactivate video calling features. The app is only available via third-party websites.

The tampered variant of the app detected by Kaspersky comes equipped with capabilities to gather unique device identifiers, which are sent to a remote server that responds back with a link to a payload that's subsequently downloaded, decrypted, and launched by the Triada trojan.

The payload, for its part, can be employed to carry out a wide range of malicious activities ranging from downloading additional modules and displaying full-screen ads to stealthily subscribing the victims to premium services and signing into WhatsApp accounts on the device. Even worse, the attackers can hijack and take control of the WhatsApp accounts to carry out social engineering attacks or distribute spam messages, thus propagating the malware to other devices.

""It's worth highlighting that FMWhatsapp users grant the app permission to read their SMS messages, which means that the Trojan and all the further malicious modules it loads also gain access to them,"" the researchers said.

Citizen Lab called the new exploit chain ""FORCEDENTRY."" It's also a zero-click exploit, meaning that it can be used to trigger an infection simply by sending a malicious message to the target, even without having to click a link or view the message in question.

""As always, if NSO receives reliable information related to misuse of the system, the company will vigorously investigate the claims and act accordingly based on the findings,"" a spokesperson for NSO Group told The Guardian.

The development comes a little over a month after an extensive investigation undertaken by a consortium of 17 media organizations revealed the widespread use of NSO Group's Pegasus ""military-grade spyware"" by authoritarian regimes to facilitate human rights violations by surveilling heads of state, activists, journalists, and lawyers around the world.

The company has since temporarily blocked several government clients globally from using its technology as the company probes its potential misuse, while also acknowledging that it ""shut off five clients' access in the past several years after conducting a human rights audit, and had ended ties with two in the last year alone,"" according to the Washington Post.

The latest disclosure is significant, not least because the zero-click attack successfully works against the latest versions of iOS, but also for the fact that it bypasses a new software security feature called BlastDoor that Apple built into iOS 14 to prevent such intrusions by filtering untrusted data sent over iMessage.

The tightly sandboxed service was detailed by Google Project Zero researcher Samuel Groß earlier this January, noting that it's ""written in Swift, a (mostly) memory safe language which makes it significantly harder to introduce classic memory corruption vulnerabilities into the code base."" BlastDoor inspects inbound messages in a secure, sandboxed environment, thus preventing any malicious code inside of a message from interacting with the rest of the operating system or accessing user data.

But the very next month after its existence came to light, Citizen Lab said it observed NSO Group deploying FORCEDENTRY — which Amnesty International dubbed ""Megalodon"" — against iOS versions 14.4 and 14.6 as a zero-day expressly engineered to get around the BlastDoor feature by crashing IMTranscoderAgent, a service responsible for transcoding and previewing images in iMessage, in order to download and render items from the Pegasus infection server.

""While the ransomware crisis appears poised to get worse before it gets better, the cast of cybercrime groups that cause the most damage is constantly changing,"" Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42 threat intelligence team said in a report shared with The Hacker News.

""Groups sometimes go quiet when they've achieved so much notoriety that they become a priority for law enforcement. Others reboot their operations to make them more lucrative by revising their tactics, techniques and procedures, updating their software and launching marketing campaigns to recruit new affiliates.""

The development comes as ransomware attacks are getting bigger and more frequent, growing in size and severity, while also evolving beyond financial extortion to an urgent national security and safety concern that has threatened schools, hospitals, businesses, and governments across the world, prompting international authorities to formulate a series of actions against both operators of ransomware and the broader ecosystem of IT and money laundering infrastructure that's abused to siphon funds.

Chief among the new entrants is AvosLocker, a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) group that commenced operations in late June via ""press releases"" that are branded with a blue beetle logo to recruit new affiliates. The cartel, which also runs a data leak and extortion site, is said to have breached six organizations in the U.S., U.K., U.A.E., Belgium, Spain, and Lebanon, with ransom demands ranging anywhere from $50,000 to $75,000.

In contrast, Hive, despite opening shop in the same month as AvosLocker, has already hit several healthcare providers and mid-size organizations, including a European airline company and three U.S.-based entities, among other victims located in Australia, China, India, Netherlands, Norway, Peru, Portugal, Switzerland, Thailand, and the U.K.

Also detected in the wild is a Linux variant of the HelloKitty ransomware, which singles out Linux servers running VMware's ESXi hypervisor. ""The observed variants impacted five organizations in Italy, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands and the U.S.,"" Unit 42 researchers Doel Santos and Ruchna Nigam said. ""The highest ransom demand observed from this group was $10 million, but at the time of writing, the threat actors have only received three transactions that sum up to about $1.48 million.""

Last to join the list is LockBit 2.0, an established ransomware group that resurfaced in June with 2.0 version of their affiliate program touting its ""unparalleled benefits"" of ""encryption speed and self-spread function."" Not only do the developers claim it's ""the fastest encryption software all over the world,"" the group offers a stealer named StealBit that enables the attackers to download victims' data.

Since its June 2021 debut, LockBit 2.0 has compromised 52 organizations in accounting, automotive, consulting, engineering, finance, high-tech, hospitality, insurance, law enforcement, legal services, manufacturing, non-profit energy, retail, transportation, and logistics industries spanning across Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Germany, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Romania, Switzerland, the U.K., and the U.S.

Governmental bodies like Indiana, Maryland, and New York City, and private companies such as American Airlines, Ford, J.B. Hunt, and Microsoft are said to have been impacted. Among the most sensitive information that was left in the open were 332,000 email addresses and employee IDs used by Microsoft's own global payroll services, as well as more than 85,000 records related to Business Tools Support and Mixed Reality portals.

Power Apps is a Microsoft-powered development platform for building low-code custom business apps that work across mobile and the web using prebuilt templates, in addition to offering APIs to enable access to data by other applications, including options to retrieve and store information. The company describes the service as a ""suite of apps, services, and connectors, as well as a data platform, that provides a rapid development environment to build custom apps for your business needs.""

But a misconfiguration in the way a portal could share and store data could lead to a scenario wherein sensitive data is made publicly accessible, resulting in a potential data leak.

""Power Apps portals have options built in for sharing data, but they also have built in data types that are inherently sensitive,"" the researchers said. ""In cases like registration pages for COVID-19 vaccinations, there are data types that should be public, like the locations of vaccination sites and available appointment times, and sensitive data that should be private, like the personally identifying information of the people being vaccinated.""

UpGuard said it notified Microsoft of the data leakage in June 24, 2021, only for the company to initially close the case, citing the behavior was ""by design"" but subsequently take actions to alert its government cloud customers of the issue in the wake of an abuse report filed by the security firm on July 15.

Additionally, Microsoft has released a tool called Portal Checker to diagnose any potential exposure arising out of misconfiguration reasons and has made updates so that ""newly created portals will have table permissions enforced for all forms and lists irrespective of the Enable Table Permissions setting.""

""While we understand (and agree with) Microsoft's position that the issue here is not strictly a software vulnerability, it is a platform issue that requires code changes to the product, and thus should go in the same workstream as vulnerabilities,"" the researchers noted.

""It is a better resolution to change the product in response to observed user behaviors than to label systemic loss of data confidentiality an end user misconfiguration, allowing the problem to persist and exposing end users to the cybersecurity risk of a data breach."""

Especially in technology solutions, there is no end to the services of which organizations can avail themselves.

In addition, if a business needs a particular solution or service they don't handle in-house, there is most likely a third-party vendor that can take care of that for them.

It is highly beneficial for businesses today to access these large pools of third-party resources. However, there can be security challenges for companies using third-party vendors and their services despite the benefits. Let's look at navigating vendor risk management as IT professionals and see how businesses can accomplish this in a highly complex cybersecurity world.

How can third-party vendors introduce cybersecurity risks?

As mentioned, third-party vendors can be highly beneficial to organizations doing business today. They allow companies to avoid building out technology and other solutions in-house and consume these as a service. These services are crucial for small organizations that may not have the resources or technical expertise to build out the infrastructure and software solutions needed.

However, when companies interact with technology solutions that integrate with their business-critical and sensitive systems, they must consider the potential cybersecurity risks involved.

As the proverbial ""weakest link in the chain,"" if the cybersecurity practices and posture of a third-party vendor are poor, if their solutions integrate with your systems, the resulting cybersecurity risks now affect your systems. What are the real-world consequences of a vendor-related data breach?

Take note of the following. In 2013, Target Corporation, known as one of the giant retailers in the U.S., fell victim to a data breach due to the hack of a third-party company possessing network credentials for Target's network.

Attackers first hacked the network of Fazio Mechanical Services, a provider of refrigeration and HVAC services for Target. As a result, attackers compromised 40 million accounts, and Target agreed to pay $10 million in damages to customers who had data stolen.

What is Vendor Risk Management (VRM)?

To meet the cybersecurity challenges in working with third-party vendors, organizations must focus on vendor risk management (VRM). What is VRM? Vendor risk management (VRM) allows organizations to focus on discovering and mitigating risks associated with third-party vendors.

With VRM, businesses have visibility into the vendors they have established relationships with and the security controls they have implemented to ensure their systems and processes are safe and secure.

With the significant risks and compliance regulations that have evolved for businesses today, VRM is a discipline that must be given due attention and have the buy-in from IT professionals and board members alike.

Navigating Vendor Risk Management as IT Professionals

Primarily, the responsibility to discover, understand, and mitigate vendor risk management related to overall cybersecurity falls on the IT department and SecOps. In addition, IT is often responsible for forming the VRM strategy for the business and ensuring the organization's overall cybersecurity is not sacrificed working with third-party solutions.

To implement a VRM successfully, organizations need to have a framework for managing vendor risk. Here are the seven steps we recommend taking to make sure your organization is safe from vendor risk:

Identify all vendors providing services for your organization Define the acceptable level of risk for your organization Identify the most critical risks Classify the vendors who provide services for your business Conduct regular vendor risk assessments Have valid contracts with vendors and proactively track the terms Monitor vendor risks over time

1 — Identify all vendors providing services for your organization

Before you can effectively understand the risk to your business, you need to know all vendors used by your organization. A thorough inventory may include everything from lawn care to credit card services.

However, having a thorough understanding and inventory of all vendors helps to ensure risk is calculated appropriately.

2 — Define the acceptable level of risk for your organization

Different types of businesses may have different expectations and risk areas that differ. For example, what is defined as important to a healthcare organization may vary from a financial institution. Whatever the case, determining the acceptable levels of risks helps ensure the appropriate mitigations are put in place, and the risk is acceptable to business stakeholders.

3 — Identify the most critical risks

The risk posed by certain vendors is most likely going to be greater than others. For example, a lawn care company with no access to your technical infrastructure will probably be less risky than a third-party vendor with network-level access to certain business-critical systems. Therefore, ranking your risk levels related to specific vendors is vital to understanding your overall risk.

4 — Classify the vendors who provide services for your business

After vendors are identified who provide services for your business, these should be classified according to what services they offer and the risks they pose to your business.

5 — Conduct regular vendor risk assessments

Even if a business poses a slight risk at one point, this may change later. Like your business, the state of vendor infrastructure, services, software, and cybersecurity posture is constantly in flux. Therefore, perform regular vendor assessments to quickly identify a sudden change in the risk to your organization.

6 — Have valid contracts with vendors and proactively track the terms

Ensure you have valid contracts with all vendors. A contractual agreement legally establishes the expectations across all fronts, including security and risk assessment. Track the contracts and terms over time. It allows identifying any deviation from the contract terms as expressed.

7 — Monitor vendor risks over time

Monitor the risks posed by vendors over time. As discussed above, conducting regular vendor risk assessments and monitoring the risk over time helps to gain visibility into the risk that may continue to grow with a particular vendor. It may signal the need to look for another vendor.

Track credential security for third-party vendors

An area of concern working with a vendor or if you are a third-party vendor used by an organization is credentials. How do you ensure that credentials used by third-party vendors are secure? How do you prove you are on top of password security in your environment if a business requests proof of your credential security?

Specops Password Policy is a solution that allows businesses to bolster their password security and overall cybersecurity posture by:

Breached password protection

Implementing strong password policies

Allowing the use of multiple password dictionaries

Clear and intuitive client messaging

Real-time dynamic feedback to the client

Length-based password expiration

Blocking of common password components such as usernames in passwords

Easily implement passphrases

Regular expressions

Specops Breached Password Protection now includes Live Attack Data as part of the Specops Breached Password Protection module. It allows Specops Password Policy with Breached Password Protection to protect your organization from breached passwords from both billions of breached passwords in the Specops database as well as from live attack data.

Protect vendor passwords with Specops Breached Password Protection

If third-party vendor credentials in use in your environment become breached, you will be able to remediate the risk as soon as possible. Also, in conjunction with Specops Password Auditor, you can quickly and easily produce reports of the password standards you have in place in your organization.

Produce audit reports using Specops Password Auditor

Wrapping it Up

Vendor Risk Management (VRM) is an essential part of the overall cybersecurity processes of organizations today. It allows managing the risks associated with third-party vendors and how these interact with your organization. Businesses must implement a framework to evaluate vendor risk and ensure these risks are tracked, documented, and monitored as needed.

Specops Password Policy and Specops Password Auditor allow businesses to bolster password security in their environment. It helps mitigate any risks associated with vendor passwords and easily monitors passwords to know if these become breached. In addition, Password Auditor can produce reports if you provide third-party services to organizations requesting you provide information regarding your password settings and policies."

The third edition of Standard 1164, Pipeline Control Systems Cybersecurity, has been in the works since 2017, and it’s based on input from over 70 organizations. The standard is based on NIST’s Cybersecurity Framework and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation Critical Infrastructure Protection (NERC CIP) standards.

According to the API, which is the largest trade association for the oil and natural gas industry, this edition covers all control systems, rather than just SCADA systems as the previous edition did.

The new standard describes requirements for hardening pipeline assets against ransomware and other threats. It includes recommendations for protections at critical connection points in the supply chain (i.e. terminals, pipelines and refineries), risk assessment guidance, a model for implementing pipeline security, and a framework for an industrial automation and control security program.

API says the new edition, which can be purchased for $200, can be paired with other standards, such as its Standard 780, which focuses on security risk assessments, and its recommended practices for pipeline safety management systems.

“This standard will help protect the nation’s critical pipeline infrastructure by enhancing safeguards for both digital and operational control systems, improving safety and preventing disruptions along the entire pipeline supply chain,” said Debra Phillips, senior VP of API Global Industry Services. “What sets this framework apart is its adaptive risk assessment model that provides operators with an appropriate degree of flexibility to proactively mitigate against the rapidly evolving cyber threat matrix.”

The new edition of the pipeline cybersecurity standard was published in the wake of the cyberattack that targeted Colonial Pipeline. The ransomware attack that came to light in May caused significant disruption and it prompted the reintroduction of the Pipeline Security Act, a TSA directive ordering pipelines to increase defenses, the DHS requiring pipeline operators to bolster cybersecurity, and other initiatives focusing on critical infrastructure security.

“Industry standards and best practices are paramount in ensuring critical infrastructures and their operations are secured against malicious threats and other vulnerabilities,” cybersecurity firm Trend Micro said on Monday in a blog post commenting on the new edition of the API standard. “With threat actors becoming more sophisticated, government agencies and private enterprises must future-proof their control systems and cybersecurity frameworks to minimize the risk of cyber attacks that could cause them millions of dollars and disruptions.”

“Single-factor authentication is a common low-security method of authentication. It only requires matching one factor—such as a password—to a username to gain access to a system,” CISA says.

While the agency mainly refers to “the use of single-factor authentication for remote or administrative access systems” as being an “exceptionally risky” cybersecurity practice, the lack of two-factor authentication is regarded as low-security overall and should be avoided as much as possible.

The use of strong passwords has been long promoted as one of the most accessible means of securing accounts, but even some of the commonly used two-factor authentication methods are already considered insecure – such as SMS – given the ease at which attackers may compromise them.

As such, the use of a strong 2FA method is recommended in all instances, especially when it comes to remote access to enterprise environments or critical systems, and it’s no surprise that CISA too warned of the weaknesses inherited with the use of single-factor authentication.

“Although these Bad Practices should be avoided by all organizations, they are especially dangerous in organizations that support Critical Infrastructure or National Critical Functions,” CISA notes.

Organizations in all sectors are encouraged to review CISA’s Bad Practices list and take the necessary steps to ensure they address any security weaknesses in their implementations.

Those that haven’t already adopted 2FA in their environments are advised to review the agency’s guide on implementing strong authentication and apply the recommended best practices as soon as possible.

Fortress Security Store is a physical security solutions provider based in the United States. The company says thousands of consumers and businesses use its products.

The flaws were found in Fortress’ S03 WiFi Security System, which connects to an existing Wi-Fi network or phone line. The system can include security cameras, window and door sensors, motion detectors, glass break and vibration sensors, as well as smoke, gas and water alarms.

Rapid7 researchers discovered that the product is affected by two vulnerabilities — both rated medium severity based on their CVSS score — that can be exploited remotely.

One of them, tracked as CVE-2021-39276, has been described as an unauthenticated API access issue. An attacker who knows the targeted user’s email address — the attack cannot be launched without this piece of information — can use the email address to query the API and obtain the security system’s associated IMEI number. Once they have obtained the IMEI, the attacker can send unauthenticated POST requests to make changes to the system, including to disarm it.

The second flaw, tracked as CVE-2021-39277, can be exploited to launch a radio frequency (RF) signal replay attack. Due to the fact that communications between different components of the home security system are not properly protected, an attacker can capture various commands — such as arm or disarm — using a software-defined radio device, and then replay those commands at a later time.

This attack does not require any prior knowledge of the targeted system, but it can only be launched by an attacker who is in the radio range of the target.

Rapid7 said it initially reported the flaws to Fortress in mid-May and again in mid-August. However, there does not appear to be a patch for the vulnerabilities.

There is not much that users can do to prevent RF attacks — except to avoid using key fobs and other RF devices linked to the system. Exploitation of CVE-2021-39276 can be prevented by registering the system with a unique email address that an attacker is unlikely to guess or obtain.

SecurityWeek has reached out to Fortress for comment, but we have not received a reply beyond an automated email confirming that our message was received.

Tracked as CVE-2021-33766 and referred to as ProxyToken, the vulnerability has a severity rating of medium (CVSS score of 6.5). The security hole was identified by Le Xuan Tuyen of VNPT ISC, working with Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).

The security bug is related to the authentication of requests to services within the ecp web application and can be exploited using crafted requests to bypass authentication.

“With this vulnerability, an unauthenticated attacker can perform configuration actions on mailboxes belonging to arbitrary users. As an illustration of the impact, this can be used to copy all emails addressed to a target and account and forward them to an account controlled by the attacker,” ZDI’s Simon Zuckerbraun explains.

The issue exists because none of the sites that Exchange creates in IIS (one functioning as a front-end and the other as a back-end) authenticates specific requests when the Delegated Authentication feature is not enabled and a non-empty cookie named SecurityToken is employed.

“In summary, when the front end sees the SecurityToken cookie, it knows that the back end alone is responsible for authenticating this request. Meanwhile, the back end is completely unaware that it needs to authenticate some incoming requests based upon the SecurityToken cookie, since the DelegatedAuthModule is not loaded in installations that have not been configured to use the special delegated authentication feature,” Zuckerbraun notes.

He also explains that unauthenticated requests may be issued as well, because if requests to a /ecp page don’t include an “ECP canary” ticket, an HTTP 500 response is returned, and a valid canary is included in the response.

An attacker with an account on the same Exchange server as the victim may exploit the vulnerability to set a forwarding rule that would allow them to read all the victim’s incoming mail. Provided that the Exchange administrator has set a global configuration value to allow the use of forwarding rules to arbitrary Internet destinations, no Exchange credentials are needed for the exploit.

“Furthermore, since the entire /ecp site is potentially affected, various other means of exploitation may be available as well,” Zuckerbraun says.

Microsoft informed users about the availability of patches for Exchange Server 2013, 2016 and 2019 with an advisory issued in July, but the actual fixes were released in April.

“This is an interesting security vulnerability, but because this requires an existing active account on Microsoft Exchange to begin with...this is not a huge external threat. It can be used as part of a chained exploit where the attacker has already gained access, and it can be used for spear phishing, eavesdropping and even escalation of privilege attacks...so it is not nothing. Anyone can think up some malicious attacks using it, if the initial access is already gained,” Roger Grimes, data driven defense evangelist at KnowBe4, said in an emailed comment.

Updates announced by the OpenSSL Project on August 24 patched CVE-2021-3711, a high-severity buffer overflow related to SM2 decryption, and CVE-2021-3712, a medium-severity flaw that can be exploited for denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, and possibly for the disclosure of private memory contents.

The high-severity vulnerability, patched with the release of OpenSSL 1.1.1l, can allow an attacker to change an application’s behavior or cause it to crash. The changes an attacker could make depend on the targeted app and the type of data it processes.

Cybersecurity firm Sophos, which published an analysis of the two OpenSSL vulnerabilities, noted that an attacker could trick an application “into thinking that something succeeded (or failed) when it didn’t, or even to take over the flow of program execution entirely.”

Several major organizations whose products rely on OpenSSL have released security advisories, including Linux distributions such as Red Hat (not affected), Ubuntu, SUSE, Debian, and Alpine Linux.

Network-attached storage (NAS) appliance maker Synology has informed customers that the OpenSSL vulnerabilities impact its Synology DiskStation Manager (DSM), Synology Router Manager (SRM), VPN Plus Server, and VPN Server products.

The company has assigned “important” and “moderate” severity ratings to these vulnerabilities and says it’s working on patches.

Synology competitor QNAP has also released an advisory, telling customers that it’s “thoroughly investigating the case” and it “will release security updates and provide further information as soon as possible.”

Another storage solutions provider, US-based NetApp, is currently trying to determine which of its products are affected. To date it has confirmed that Clustered Data ONTAP, E-Series SANtricity OS controller software, the NetApp Manageability SDK, NetApp SANtricity SMI-S Provider, and NetApp Storage Encryption are impacted. Dozens of products are still under investigation.

Other major companies, such as Cisco and Broadcom, are also expected to release advisories describing the impact of the latest OpenSSL vulnerabilities on their products.

Previous Columns by Keith Ibarguen: A Case for Recruiting and Retaining ""Franchise Players"" in Security Software Development Leveraging People in the Email Security Battle","Critical elements required to attract and retain A-players for cybersecurity software teams

Meeting Larry Bird at Boston Logan International Airport might not seem like much on the surface, but for a kid from Maine who grew up watching the battles between he and Magic, it was something I’ve never forgotten. Larry, Magic, Michael, Cal, and more recently, Tom, are professional athletes who don’t even need their last names listed to recognize them and their contributions to not only the sport they played, but to the communities, teams and teammates they had.

These athletes are franchise A-players, who performed at an extremely high level on teams that were the best of their time. Though it may seem a stretch to compare a modern software team to the Celtics of the 80s, there are worthy comparisons on the importance of A-grade franchise players that elevate the entirety of the team. I experienced this dynamic early in my career, where I was part of a team that, in retrospect, was way more elite than I had recognized at the time. In looking at this team in the rear-view mirror, there were some attributes that contributed to the performance that I think other organizations could learn from when hiring software developers building security focused solutions.

As we emerge from a pandemic, increasing employee turnover across almost every vertical is an important point of discussion for cybersecurity. People are seeking change, and as employers, we need to meet those needs with clear eyes if we are going to retain top talent. Now more than ever, there is downward pressure on software development cost. This is true for all software, not just cyber security. But with cybersecurity, the importance of getting software right is extremely high. Every day we hear of breaches that cost a company millions of dollars, or cost people their privacy. Ransomware and other attacks have caused tremendous damage and loss, and it is the cybersecurity professional whose job it is to weather these attacks.

If there is an industry that needs A-grade developers, it’s in cybersecurity, especially in critical decision and design roles. The job market today versus the market in the late 2000s is drastically different, however, there are similarities around motivation that are still true today – especially for developers of cybersecurity software such that has such an important role of protecting us. With that as a backdrop, I would like to discuss four critical elements required to attract and retain A-players for cybersecurity software teams:

1. A tremendous sense of mission

The mission for the team I was a part of was baked into the customer we were working for; success had clear impacts on the security of the nation, which drove the team forward. There were people relying on the completion of the capabilities we built, and quality was paramount. In addition, the technology was hard, so there was a sense that this was not able to be done by just anyone. Cybersecurity has many of these same merits. With such importance around protecting IT systems and data, evangelizing how the next product or feature contributes to this mission is an obvious way to not only describe the feature, but also create a sense of purpose across the development team. Establishing this purpose, and sharing the value that end users get from the software is critical to allow the engineers to connect with the result. The clearer that connection, the stronger the sense of mission and the greater commitment the engineer will have this mission.

2. An expectation of high performance that when missed, is addressed immediately

With the Celtics of the 80’s, as with all high-performing teams, there is an expectation of high performance. The A-players are raising all boats, and those boats had better be able to rise to the occasion or they will be let go. Competitive A-players expect a lot of others around them. They don’t always expect perfection, but if you’re going to make a mistake, it better be because you are pushing the envelope, not because you weren’t blocking and tackling. Allowing mediocrity to exist will kill motivation of your highest performers. On my high performing team, issues were handled head-on. Some found that direct approach off-putting at times, but for the majority of times, issues were handled in the context of improvement, not to tear someone down. If not handled, you’re a-players will leave, so set expectations of working hard, allow risk taking and allow failure, but address any nonchalance promptly.

3. Exceptional hiring driven by internal referrals

A-managers look for A-players, so when you’ve identified your A-players, incentivize them to bring on others. Top talent usually won’t refer someone if they feel they would bring down the overall strength of the team. Create referral bonuses for these folks that make a dent in their pockets. It is small money to offer a multi-thousand dollar referral bonus when you get 4x the productivity from the hire. It’s worth every nickel.

4. Confidence inspiring leadership

Confidence inspiring leadership helps hold it all together. This includes everything from the sharing of purpose, sharing of successes and failures, the willingness to address difficult circumstances head on and the expectation of exceptional performance, to the support of those who need help, both inside the workplace and in personal life. All the attributes you read about in the millions of management books really boil down to being able to have real conversations. Check in with you’re a-players, share the value of their work with them, and encourage your A-player managers to address the team with a combination of support and humanity, expectation, and context, joined with a desire to see situations as much as possible through the eyes of the employee. In other words, to be able to empathize, while expecting greatness.

People change jobs much more frequently today than 20 years ago, and there are clear benefits to doing so for the employee. Job changing allows employees to sample companies, gain more of a network, create broader experience, and increase salary more quickly. So, pay matters! A few ways to compete in the market are to establish a bonus structure that incentivizes the right performance and clearly aligns to results you’re seeking. Another option is to make the employee a strong part of the organization through equity. Top A-players aren’t franchise players without skin in the game. Money won’t motivate over time, but without it, you can’t get the best in the door.

This type of dedication to a cause or a company is not done by accident, and I don’t believe it is lost from the human element of work today. I see resumes every day that have employees who have been in the workforce for 15 years and have never stayed at one company more than 3. But when you ask these folks why this is, they usually reply, “well, I just haven’t found that sweet-spot”. I believe great franchise players can be attracted and retained, but not without addressing how people today find and maintain their career sweet-spot and are motivated by what they are doing, and that is not built by accident.

SecurityWeek talked to the CISOs at Zoom and Thycotic – companies that are both front and center in the expanding remote working or work from home (WFH) culture. Jason Lee is CISO at Zoom Video Communications (Nasdaq: ZM). Joe Carson is the chief security scientist (CSS) & advisory CISO at Thycotic.

We wanted to know, first and foremost, is there any career path left for a CISO; or is there nowhere else to go. Is being a CISO effectively a dead-end job?

Dead-end job

“It’s not a dead-end job,” said Carson. “You’ve reached the top of the pillar in one aspect of the business, but it’s not the only position a CISO can occupy.” He pointed to the CIO, “often considered a higher-level board or executive team member than the CISO.” A combined CIO/CISO position would give the CISO responsibility for the entirety of a company’s information, not just its security – but it is not entirely certain that CISOs would consider it anything more than a sideways rather than upwards movement.

Alternatively, suggested Carson, a very technically oriented CISO might have the opportunity to move into a chief technology officer (CTO) role. The difference between the two opportunities is that the CTO role would require an almost visionary approach to emerging technology, while the CIO role would require a deeper business perspective.

Lee has already seen a developing trend for the CISO to take over the CIO role. It’s a concept not unknown to the business world, where a subsidiary becomes so successful that it takes over or possibly becomes more important than the original parent organization.

“There's a couple of cases,” he said, “where the CISO is starting to take over the role of the IT organization and IT responsibilities.” What interests Lee is that the CISO’s risk management expertise is being added to IT operations – a technical CISO with added risk management expertise becomes an attractive option for the modern CIO.

The concept of risk management – something all CISOs must understand – is the important element. We have seen many times in this series that the modern CISO needs to understand and be fully immersed in the business side of the organization. So, the modern CISO needs to be technically minded, deeply involved in all aspects of the business, and conversant with the principles and practice of risk management. That is almost a job-description for a Chief Risk Officer – and CRO, one of the most senior positions in any company, is certainly a potential aspiration for any career-minded CISO.

Current reporting

For now, the most common reporting hierarchy for the CISO is to the CIO. This remains a complex issue. The diplomatic response from many CISOs is they don’t mind who they report to so long as there is a good strong supportive relationship between the two. But that is not always possible. The CISO needs that relationship to perform his or her job. The CIO does not need the CISO to manage the IT and infrastructure side of things. So, the onus is one-sidedly on the CISO to make the relationship work.

The problem is a potential conflict of interest caused by different priorities. The CIO might wish to do something new to improve the business of information which the CISO considers to create a security risk. “What you really don’t want,” says Carson, “is your superior sacrificing security for the business priority.”

He offers two solutions – the first being reactive and the second being more proactive. “I always recommend that no matter what you do, you always stick by your ethics, you stick by basically what is the right thing to do,” he explains. That means, in the face of a veto, you document your recommendations. “So, if something does happen, you do have the ability to go back and say, this was our recommendation, this is what we recommended. It was vetoed.”

The more proactive solution is to have a decision-making committee. While the CISO may technically still report to the CIO, security decisions should be made by a group of people ideally comprising the CEO, the CFO, the CRO, and the CIO. If this arrangement does not already exist, the CISO should attempt to engineer it. “All of them together should be finalizing the recommendations of the CISO,” said Carson. “You’ve then got basically, a major part of the executive board team, who all have some responsibility to the security of the organization, providing their weight into the decision. It removes any simple conflict of interest between the CISO and CIO.”

Recruitment and diversity

Recruitment remains a problem area for the CISO. The cyber skills gap is well-documented ‒ meaning the CISO must often choose between lowering his sights or leaving the vacancy open. Different CISOs have evolved different approaches to resolving this issue.

“I have a philosophy on hiring,” said Lee, “and it's really looking at behaviors. A person doesn't necessarily need to have a computer science background, doesn't have to have that hardcore technical background to be able to come into the roles, and even leadership roles, in my organization.”

‘Potential’ is key for Lee. “I'm looking for somebody that comes in with the learner mindset,” he continued. “Technology is constantly changing in security, and you've got to want to keep learning and keep moving with it. So, I'm not necessarily looking for somebody that's a technical expert ‒ I'm looking for somebody who’s interested in the technology and excited by it; and can show the ability to contemplate future technology.”

But he added, “The other thing I’ve found is it is critical to have strong collaborators and communicators. Those soft skills are necessary because security resides in so many different parts of the organization. I'm currently under the COO, but I've seen the role under Chief Legal Officer, the CIO and other departments. Either way, it means the security team must collaborate really well with counterparts in Engineering, in IT, and in all those organizations. So, to me, somebody who can build those relationships is far more important than somebody who has a whole long list of certifications.”

Lee is really talking about another buzzword in security ‒ diversity. Diversity often focuses on the need to get more women involved in security. This is important, but diversity itself is much wider. The modern CISO seeks to incorporate a wide range of people into the security team: ethnicity, religion, academic and social background as well as gender. The theory is that diversity brings different ways of looking at and solving problems ‒ and that can only be good.

“Diversity is more important today than it's ever been in my entire time in the industry,” agrees Joe Carson. “It's not just about technology anymore. Fifteen years ago, it was just technology. But now it's so much beyond that - you must have communication skills; you must have someone who understands user behavior; you must have someone who understands about brands and impact; you must have a risk person. Diversity in the industry is so essential that it's no longer about just having good technical skills. When you have a cyberattack or a cyber incident, or a ransomware attack, it requires a huge amount of diversity of skillsets, and backgrounds of people to be able to handle that.”

In today’s world, he suggests, where technology is everywhere and everyone is connected, “diversity is essential for the business to ensure it has what I call a 360 security strategy, rather than just an old traditional technical strategy.”

So, we asked him the ultimate question for diversity in recruitment: would you hire a reformed hacker?

“Absolutely, yes,” he said. “Hackers have a unique perspective on the world.” He stresses, however, that the CISO would need to take extra concern over vetting, be certain there’s an adequate level of mutual trust the two, and ensure constant visibility into the work being done.

“But, absolutely yes,” he continued. “The best people in the organization to help you detect attacks are previous victims and hackers. Victims of attacks are sometimes your best advocates within the organization. And former hackers are your best threat hunters, able to determine when something suspicious is happening. So absolutely, hire them. They're the people that have the perspective into thinking like a hacker; and I think all organizations must have at least one person who has that mindset.”

Attributes of the modern CISO

Being CISO is clearly a complex and difficult job, demanding specific personal attributes. Carson lists four: leadership, communication skills, ability to translate between technical and business, and the ability to listen. Leadership involves being on top of everything all the time, so that you know where to find anything at a moment’s notice.

Leadership is an interesting one: are you born with that quality or is it something you can learn? “It is something you can learn,” says Carson. “Some people learn it faster than others, but it's something that can be taught and learned.”

He suggests getting a leadership mentor. “When I was young,” he said, “I was an introvert and very shy. I was struggling to stand up in front of a crowd and speak.” To solve the problem, he surrounded himself with great leaders. “I looked for people who were great at that area, I watched and learned, and I absorbed some of those skills into my own personal capabilities. So absolutely, leadership is not something you are born with, it's not genetic. However, depending on the person's personality, it can be learned quicker or slower. It’s the acceleration of learning which is critical, how fast you can pick it up.”

Lee agrees that leadership can be learned. “There are many kinds of leadership. You need to understand what your strengths are, and you can build on those strengths. One of my favorite books is Marcus Buckingham’s Now, Discover Your Strengths. And I’m a huge believer in the concept of ‘servant leadership’. When I’m talking to my team I like to ask, ‘how do I enable you to work faster? Do you have any roadblocks? What do you need?’. So, I feel I’m empowering the team, because I’m really just a conduit making sure that the security program is moving forward, and the partnership across the company is going well. So, Servant Leadership is a big, big thing that I like to focus in on.

“But it takes time to hone these skills, and just because you're a people-manager, doesn't make you a leader. You don't even have to be managing people to be a leader.”

From Carson’s remaining attributes, communications and interpreter go together. “You need to have very strong communication skills,” he said. “But that’s not enough on its own. Within that communication you must also be a good interpreter ‒ you must be able to translate very technical issues into good business speak, and vice versa.” To achieve this level, you need Carson’s fourth attribute: to be a good listener in order to understand.

“In my early years,” he said, “I tried spending a day or two in the employees’ situation, to understand what it's like in their chair, to understand what it's like to walk in their shoes, and get a feeling about - the critical decisions they have to make on a day-to-day basis. It’s when you put yourself into that scenario that you start to understand your job is not security ‒ your job is to help others be successful, while at the same time reducing the risk against the business.”

Lee also agrees with the need for similar communication/interpretive skills. “Being able to communicate that business context and being able to build really strong relationships with all your peers across the organization are really important. I have a fantastic relationship with the president of Engineering at Zoom. We'll have meetings where literally our hats are switched ‒ he's approaching things from the CISO perspective, and discussing it, and I'm doing the same from the technology side. Being able to build that sort of strong relationship, where you can switch and go back and forth with each other on it is, well, really critical!”

The remaining attributes for Lee are to be adaptable and able to move fast. “I think all the CISOs going through the pandemic have had to do this, or have struggled if they can't adapt.”

Advice: received and given

Part of listening is listening to good advice; and part of communicating is giving good advice. The best advice Carson ever received came from Brian Honan, who was his manager 22 years ago ‒ and is still a mentor today. “I’m a techie,” explained Carson, and I’m also a perfectionist. Artists are often perfectionists while working on a new painting ‒ they’re not comfortable with other people seeing their work until it’s finished and perfect. But that can take a long time and the approach doesn’t work for a CISO. Brian’s advice to me was, ‘Joe, I know you’re a perfectionist, but you have to open up and let other people see what you’re working on, because their feedback is important.’”

The advice Carson would give to aspiring security leaders today (advice he was given some 15 years ago) is the most important asset we have in this world is ‘time’. “We have to make sure that we make the most efficient use of our time. If it takes me three hours to do something, and it takes a colleague one hour, I should delegate to the colleague who can do it faster. Time is our most valuable asset ‒ don’t waste it.”

The best advice that Lee ever received was wrapped in a story from an earlier manager, but also stresses feedback. The manager was preparing for promotion, and went to talk to his boss. The boss said there were three things he needed to work on. Given the first one, the manager pushed back and suggested the boss hadn’t understood the context of why he was there. The boss simply replied, ‘Okay, we’re done.’ The manager asked why, when there were two other areas he should work on. “It’s clear,” said the boss, “that you’re not ready to hear feedback.”

The moral that Lee took from this: “When you get feedback,” he said, “always accept it as a gift designed to make you better. You may not like it, it may taste bad, but it's always something worth thinking about. Think about how to be constructive with it, and take it. Don't defend your position, just accept the feedback, and learn from it. The other part of this is to make sure that your manager is giving you feedback and keep asking for feedback. It’s important for your development.”

Lee would offer the same advice to others, but would have one more offering for anyone wishing to be a CISO or to advance a career in any other role ‒ the notion of being a multiplier. “As an individual contributor,” he explained, it's good to be able to say, ‘I doubled the amount of work I did last year’. That's fantastic, doing twice as much work! However, the person that succeeds the most is the one who helps five others double their work. Really being able to multiply and help others be successful, those are the ones that really succeed. Look for those opportunities to be a multiplier, always.”

Future threats

In a slight variation from our usual question on future threats, we asked our CISOs what needs to be done to cope with the future threats. For Lee, the priority must be at the endpoint. “There’s no more perimeter to defend. Your endpoints, wherever they are, are the network edge.” He advocates the zero-trust model for protection.

“However,” he added, “you have to keep a focus on the ransomware and phishing so prevalent today ‒ which means you need a new style of learning and training system for all your remote workers. How do you make that engaging, inclusive and effective when you can’t bring everyone into the big auditorium? I’m a huge fan of gamification and having competitions around learning. We’ve got to keep pushing the bar in this area.”

Carson sees a similar future with a similar solution: the perimeter has gone, and remote working is here to stay. The pandemic accelerated the move to working from home and the associated increase in cloud and cloud applications. This is causing difficulties for the SOC. “Getting true visibility with that is difficult today,” he said, “because you might have different dashboards that only give you certain visibility into certain parts of the full estate. You might have a dashboard that shows your Cloud; you might have a dashboard that shows your own premises, a dashboard that shows certain devices. Getting full and central visibility is essential.”

On the endpoint, he said, “Remote working will become a permanent fixture for many organizations, and that means that Cloud and ‘use any device from any location’ will become the norm. This is really where the new perimeter is: identity, data, and access. That's where security lies in the future, and those are the three important ingredients that organizations must invest in to ensure they can continue innovating and providing access.”

But there is also an unexpected benefit from the growth in WFH. “Organizations who historically might have traditionally had a perimeter office-based type of culture, will find they are now able to expand their talent pool ‒ because now they can have a global talent pool, rather than a location-based talent pool. Organizations now have a much wider and more flexible talent pool to hire from because the world is adapting to a remote working culture.”

The artificial intelligence model was designed to help programmers with their work by suggesting lines of code right in the editor. For that, Copilot was trained on publicly available open-source code, with support for dozens of programming languages, including Go, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and TypeScript.

Looking at the code produced by Copilot, a group of five researchers concluded that a high percentage of it is vulnerable because the AI was trained on vulnerable code.

“However, code often contains bugs—and so, given the vast quantity of unvetted code that Copilot has processed, it is certain that the language model will have learned from exploitable, buggy code. This raises concerns on the security of Copilot’s code contributions,” the researchers say.

The researchers analyzed the manner in which Copilot performs based on diverse weaknesses, prompts, and domains. They created 89 different scenarios in which the language model produced a total of 1,692 programs, approximately 40% of which were found to be vulnerable.

The academics performed both manual and automated analysis of the code generated by Copilot, and focused on MITRE’s 2021 CWE Top 25 list to evaluate the code generated by the AI model.

Some of the commonly encountered bugs include out-of-bounds write, cross-site scripting, out-of-bounds read, OS command injection, improper input validation, SQL injection, use-after-free, path traversal, unrestricted file upload, missing authentication, and more.

“As Copilot is trained over open-source code available on GitHub, we theorize that the variable security quality stems from the nature of the community-provided code. That is, where certain bugs are more visible in open-source repositories, those bugs will be more often reproduced by Copilot,” the researchers note.

The academics conclude that, while Copilot certainly helps developers build code faster, it’s clear that developers should remain vigilant when using the tool. They also recommend the use of security-aware tooling to reduce the risk of introducing security bugs.

The program will train selected attorneys on emerging national security and criminal cyber threats and how to fight them. The trainees will be rotating department components focused on cyber defense, such as the Criminal Division, the U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, and the National Security Division.

Participants will investigate and prosecute cybersecurity-related cases such as state-sponsored threats, international crime gangs, infrastructure and ransomware incidents, and the financing of cybercrime through cryptocurrency and money laundering.

Based in the Washington, D.C. area, the program will require all trainees to secure a Top Secret security clearance and commit for the entire duration of the program.

The DoJ also says that participants may be offered permanent positions without further competition. They may also reapply to the Honors Program in a subsequent year or may apply to permanent positions within the department.

The three-year course, which will be coordinated through the Criminal Division’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, was one of the recommendations from the DoJ’s ongoing comprehensive cyber review that Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco ordered in May.

Interested parties have until September 8 to apply to the Cyber Fellowship program, through the Justice Department’s Honors Program application portal. Applicants to this year’s Honors Program should indicate if they would like to be considered for the Cyber Fellowship.

“As we have witnessed this past year, cyber threats pose a significant and increasing risk to our national security, our economic security, and our personal security. We need to develop the next generation of prosecutors with the training and experience necessary to combat the next generation of cyber threats,” said Deputy Attorney General Monaco.

The existence of the vulnerabilities affecting Delta’s DIAEnergie product was disclosed last week by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the researcher who identified them, Michael Heinzl.

The security holes were reported to the vendor, through CISA, in April, but they have yet to be patched. CISA says patches are expected to become available on September 15. In the meantime, organizations using the affected product have been advised to implement mitigations to reduce the risk of exploitation.

Heinzl told SecurityWeek that the eight DIAEnergie vulnerabilities disclosed last week are just some of the issues he reported to the vendor. The remaining flaws will be disclosed at a later date.

Four of the eight vulnerabilities have been rated “critical” and described as blind SQL injection bugs that can be exploited by remote, unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code.

“Critical” severity ratings have also been assigned to a vulnerability that can be exploited to add new admin users and gain access to the device, and a flaw that can be leveraged for unrestricted file uploads and possibly remote code execution.

The remaining two issues have been described as medium-severity flaws that can be exploited to obtain a password in clear text and to launch cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.

The affected services are exposed to the network, which means the vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely, the researcher said. In some cases, exploitation from the internet might also be possible, depending on how the user’s network and infrastructure are configured.

“There are multiple ways how the vulnerabilities could be chained together,” Heinzl told SecurityWeek. “A malicious actor has multiple venues to achieve a complete compromise of both the DIAEnergie application itself, as well as the underlying system on which the application is deployed on.”

He added, “Examples include multiple SQL injections, which would allow an attacker to execute system commands or to retrieve credentials (stored as MD5 hashes, therefore trivial to crack) from the database, an arbitrary file upload vulnerability which also allows the execution of system commands, and others. Due to another issue related to authentication and authorization, it's possible to exploit all of these and similar privileged actions without any prior authentication.”

DIAEnergie is an industrial energy management system (IEMS) designed to help companies visualize and improve electric and power systems, particularly high-consumption equipment. The product can be used for remote maintenance and it can be integrated with various industrial control systems (ICS) and data sinks, including power meters, programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and other Modbus devices.

In its advisory, CISA says the product is used worldwide. Marketing materials provided by the vendor show that the product is used by various types of organizations, including a semiconductor factory, a bearing manufacturer, and a footwear company.

“The consequences of a malicious actor’s actions could be dire for affected customers — falsifying monitoring data, suppressing alarms, using the system as the initial foothold in the network infrastructure for further pivoting, or simply 'ransomwaring' the deployment as has become so prevalent over the last five years or so,” Heinzl explained.

SecurityWeek has reached out to the vendor for comment, but the company has yet to respond.

CISA last week also published a separate advisory describing a high-severity remote code execution vulnerability affecting Delta’s DOPSoft HMI design software. Exploitation of this flaw involves getting the targeted user to open a specially crafted file.

The vulnerability was reported to the vendor through Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) by an anonymous researcher. ZDI over the past few months has published several advisories with a “0Day” status for Delta vulnerabilities — a “0Day” status indicates that the bugs have not been patched.

T-Mobile’s CEO and an individual who claims to be behind the recent hacking of the mobile carrier’s systems have shared some information about how the attack was carried out.

In a statement issued on Friday, Mike Sievert, CEO of T-Mobile, said that while the company’s investigation into the incident was “substantially complete,” he could not share too many technical details due to the criminal investigation conducted by law enforcement. He did, however, share a high-level summary of the attack.

“What we can share is that, in simplest terms, the bad actor leveraged their knowledge of technical systems, along with specialized tools and capabilities, to gain access to our testing environments and then used brute force attacks and other methods to make their way into other IT servers that included customer data,” he said. “In short, this individual’s intent was to break in and steal data, and they succeeded.”

The Wall Street Journal reported last week that a 21-year-old man named John Binns, a US citizen living in Turkey, has taken credit for the attack, a claim that he demonstrated to the news outlet by sending messages from a Telegram account that had been used to discuss details of the breach before it became widely known.

Binns told the WSJ that he managed to infiltrate T-Mobile’s systems after identifying a vulnerable, internet-exposed router in July. He allegedly found the router using a simple, publicly-available tool. Some have speculated that this tool was likely Shodan, Nmap or Masscan.

He claimed that the router provided an entry point to T-Mobile servers in a data center near East Wenatchee, Washington, from where he obtained credentials that gave him access to more than 100 servers. Binns, who described T-Mobile’s security as “terrible,” claimed it took him roughly a week to breach the servers storing customer data.

The man said he carried out the attack to get attention. Last year, he filed a lawsuit against the CIA, FBI and other US government agencies, claiming that he had been blackmailed, surveilled and tortured.

Some cybersecurity experts have linked the online accounts used by Binns to gamers who infected devices around the world with malware in an effort to create botnets.

The T-Mobile breach came to light earlier this month, when someone offered to sell 100 million customer records on the dark web for roughly $280,000 in bitcoin. However, it’s unclear if or how much of the data was acquired by others.

T-Mobile has confirmed that the breach impacts more than 54 million current, former and prospective customers. Compromised data includes names, dates of birth, phone numbers, addresses, SSNs, driver’s license information, IMEI and IMSI information, and account PINs. The company highlighted on several occasions, including in Sievert’s statement on Friday, that customer financial information has not been exposed.

Sievert has apologized to customers for the incident and the company is offering impacted individuals two years of free identity protection services. The company has also promised to take steps to prevent these types of incidents in the future.

However, T-Mobile has disclosed several data breaches over the past years and it doesn’t seem to have learned from those incidents, something that has been mentioned in the lawsuits filed against the carrier as a result of the latest breach.

Referred to as ChaosDB, the security hole was publicly disclosed last week by researchers with the cloud security firm Wiz. Microsoft had been notified of the issue roughly one week before, and immediately took the necessary steps to address it.

Residing in the Jupyter Notebook feature of Cosmos DB, the bug could have been exploited to obtain valid credentials that would have allowed for the takeover of Cosmos DB accounts, with full administrative rights.

In a blog post on Friday, Microsoft confirmed that the vulnerability could “potentially allow a user to gain access to another customer’s resources by using the account’s primary read-write key.”

The tech giant said it found no evidence that the vulnerability was exploited to access customer data, and that it immediately took the necessary steps to notify those who might have been affected by the bug.

“This vulnerability only affects a subset of customers who had the Jupyter Notebook feature enabled. Notifications have been sent to all customers that could be potentially affected due to researcher activity, advising they regenerate their primary read-write key,” Microsoft says.

The company also notes that other keys associated with Cosmos DB accounts, such as secondary read-write keys or the primary and secondary read-only keys, were not vulnerable. Furthermore, the tech giant underlines that only those customers who were notified of the issue were potentially impacted.

Although no data was accessed because of the security hole, affected customers are advised to regenerate their primary read-write keys, Microsoft says.

The company also recommends, as a best practice, that Azure Cosmos DB customers employ network protection mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access, that they use Role Based Access Control or implement regularly scheduled key rotations, and that they apply the security best practices detailed in the Azure Cosmos DB documentation.

CISA too urges Azure Cosmos DB customers to regenerate their keys and review the guidance from Microsoft on securing Cosmos DB instances.

“CISA is aware of a misconfiguration vulnerability in Microsoft’s Azure Cosmos DB that may have exposed customer data. Although the misconfiguration appears to have been fixed within the Azure cloud, CISA strongly encourages Azure Cosmos DB customers to roll and regenerate their certificate keys,” the agency notes.

“Microsoft’s warning should serve as a wakeup call for organizations relying solely on their cloud provider for security. They must take matters into their own hands to safeguard their data, most importantly protecting it at the storage layer. This includes encrypting data both in flight and at rest to keep cybercriminals from reading it or making it public in any intelligible form,” Gary Ogasawara, CTO of Cloudian, said in an emailed comment.

Copies of the Dominion Voting Systems software used to manage elections — from designing ballots to configuring voting machines and tallying results — were distributed at an event this month in South Dakota organized by MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, an ally of former President Donald Trump who has made unsubstantiated claims about last year’s election.

“It’s a game-changer in that the environment we have talked about existing now is a reality,” said Matt Masterson, a former top election security official in the Trump administration. “We told election officials, essentially, that you should assume this information is already out there. Now we know it is, and we don’t know what they are going to do with it.”

The software copies came from voting equipment in Mesa County, Colorado, and Antrim County, Michigan, where Trump allies had sue unsuccessfully challenging the results from last fall.

The Dominion software is used in some 30 states, including counties in California, Georgia and Michigan.

Election security pioneer Harri Hursti was at the South Dakota event and said he and other researchers in attendance were provided three separate copies of election management systems that run on the Dominion software. The data indicated they were from Antrim and Mesa counties. While it’s not clear how the copies came to be released at the event, they were posted online and made available for public download.

The release gives hackers a “practice environment” to probe for vulnerabilities they could exploit and a road map to avoid defenses, Hursti said. All the hackers would need is physical access to the systems because they are not supposed to be connected to the internet.

“The door is now wide open,” Hursti said. “The only question is, how do you sneak in the door?”

A Dominion representative declined comment, citing an investigation.

U.S. election technology is dominated by just three vendors comprising 90% of the market, meaning election officials cannot easily swap out their existing technology. Release of the software copies essentially provides a blueprint for those trying to interfere with how elections are run. They could sabotage the system, alter the ballot design or even try to change results, said election technology expert Kevin Skoglund.

“This disclosure increases both the likelihood that something happens and the impact of what would happen if it does,” he said.

The effort by Republicans to examine voting equipment began soon after the November presidential election as Trump challenged the results and blamed his loss on widespread fraud, even though there has been no evidence of it.

Judges appointed by both Democrats and Republicans, election officials of both parties and Trump’s own attorney general have dismissed the claims. A coalition of federal and state election officials called the 2020 election the “most secure” in U.S. history, and post-election audits across the country found no significant anomalies.

In Antrim County, a judge had allowed a forensic exam of voting equipment after a brief mix-up of election results led to a suit alleging fraud. It was dismissed in May. Hursti said the date on the software release matches the date of the forensic exam.

Calls seeking information from Antrim County’s clerk and the local prosecutor’s office were not immediately returned; a call to the judge’s office was referred to the county clerk. The Michigan secretary of state’s office declined comment.

In Colorado, federal, state and local authorities are investigating whether Mesa County elections staff might have provided unauthorized individuals access to their systems. The county elections clerk, Tina Peters, appeared onstage with Lindell in South Dakota and told the crowd her office was being targeted by Democrats in the state.

Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold said she alerted federal election security officials of the breach and was told it was not viewed as a “significant heightening of the election risk landscape at this point.” This past week, Mesa County commissioners voted to replace voting equipment that Griswold had ordered could no longer be used.

Geoff Hale, who leads the election security effort at the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said his agency has always operated on the assumption that system vulnerabilities are known by malicious actors. Election officials are focused instead on ways they can reduce risk, such as using ballots with a paper record that can be verified by the voter and rigorous post-election audits, Hale said.

He said having Dominion’s software exposed publicly doesn’t change the agency’s guidance.

Security researcher Jack Cable said he assumes U.S. adversaries already had access to the software. He said he is more concerned the release would fan distrust among the growing number of people not inclined to believe in the security of U.S elections.

“It is a concern that people, in the pursuit of trying to show the system is insecure, are actually making it more insecure,” said Cable, who recently joined a cybersecurity firm run by former CISA Director Christopher Krebs and former Facebook security chief Alex Stamos.

Concerns over access to voting machines and software first surfaced this year in Arizona, where the Republican-controlled state Senate hired Cyber Ninjas, a firm with no previous election experience, to audit the Maricopa County election. The firm’s chief executive also had tweeted support of conspiracy theories surrounding last year’s election.

After the county’s Dominion voting systems were turned over to the firm, Arizona’s top election official said they could not be used again. The GOP-controlled Maricopa County Board of Supervisors voted in July to replace them.

Dominion has filed suits contesting various unfounded claims about its systems. In May, it called giving Cyber Ninjas access to its code “reckless,” given the firm’s bias, and said it would cause “irreparable damage” to election security.

Election technology and security expert Ryan Macias, in Arizona earlier this year to observe that review, was alarmed by a lack of cybersecurity protocols. There was no information about who was given access, whether those people had passed background checks or were asked to sign nondisclosure agreements.

Cyber Ninjas did not respond to an email with questions about the review and their security protocols.

Macias was not surprised to hear that copies of Antrim County’s election management system had surfaced online given the questionable motives of the various groups conducting the reviews and the central role that voting systems have played in conspiracy theories.

“This is what I anticipated would happen, and I anticipate it will happen yet again coming out of Arizona,” Macias said. “These actors have no liability and no rules of engagement.”"

First observed in June 2021, the Hive ransomware operation is affiliate-based, with numerous tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed, which makes mitigation challenging, the FBI says.

Hive ransomware attacks use diverse mechanisms to compromise business networks, including phishing emails for initial access and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) for lateral movement. Next, the threat actors exfiltrate data of interest and then encrypt systems on the network.

The adversaries leave a ransom note in each affected directory, providing victims with information on how to pay the ransom and threatening to make the stolen data public on the HiveLeaks Tor website.

On the compromised machines, the ransomware seeks to stop the processes of backup, cybersecurity, and file copying applications, to ensure it can encrypt all targeted files.

The ransomware drops a couple of scripts into the working directory, to perform cleanup after the encryption is completed, and to delete shadow copies, including disc backup copies, to prevent file recovery.

Encrypted files are typically appended the double final extension of *.key.hive or *.key.* and victims are warned that their data is lost if the *key.* files are modified, renamed, or deleted, the FBI says.

Victims are typically directed to a website on the Tor network and encouraged to contact the attackers through a live chat, but some have reportedly received phone calls from the adversaries. Victims are asked to pay the ransom within 2 to 6 days, but the attackers have prolonged the deadline when contacted by the victim.

The attackers also inform the victims that data stolen from organizations that are unwilling to pay the ransom will be published on a leak site accessible via Tor Browser.

Security researchers with Palo Alto Networks note that Hive has hit at least 28 organizations since June, all of which are listed on the extortion site. These include a European airline company and three organizations based in the United States (in the hardware retail, manufacturing and law sectors).

As usual, the FBI advises ransomware victims against paying a ransom to criminal actors, as this may embolden them to target more organizations and does not guarantee that the compromised data will be recovered.

The Bureau also encourages victims to share information related to the attack, as well as to take all of the necessary precautions to make sure that their data is safe, including backing up all files, using two-factor authentication, keeping systems and applications updated, using anti-malware solutions on all endpoints, and monitoring the environment for suspicious activity.

The flaw, tracked as CVE-2021-32941 and having a CVSS score of 9.4, has been described as a stack-based buffer overflow that can be exploited by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code and access sensitive information.

Nozomi said it reported the vulnerability to Annke on July 11 and a patch was delivered via a firmware update on July 22. Annke customers are advised to update their device’s firmware as soon as possible.

According to an advisory published this week by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the affected product is used worldwide.

Nozomi researchers discovered the vulnerability in Annke’s N48PBB network video recorder (NVR), which can be used to store video captured by cameras, watch live video streams, and manage cameras.

The vulnerability identified by the researchers can allow an attacker to access recorded videos, delete footage, change configurations (e.g. motion detection alarms), and shut down certain cameras or the NVR to prevent them from recording.

Nozomi has conducted a detailed analysis of the device, which included firmware extraction using a physical connection to its on-board memory. The security hole initially appeared to be a denial of service (DoS) issue, but further analysis revealed that it could be exploited for remote code execution with root privileges, leading to the device getting completely compromised.

Exploitation of the vulnerability requires authentication, but the lack of cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protections could also allow attackers to target a device without being authenticated — they would need to convince a logged-in user, operator or administrator to access a specially crafted web page while being logged in to the NVR’s admin interface.

“Modern video surveillance systems are classified as Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and represent a fundamental component of the physical security of a company,” Nozomi said in a blog post. “As is often the case with IoT, these devices, though apparently simple, suffer from the same cybersecurity risks as more traditional network devices. The well-known Mirai botnet, for instance, targeted IP cameras in the same way routers or printers can be targeted, aiming to compromise them and, subsequently, (ab)use them for large-scale network attacks.”

UPDATE: Annke has provided the following statement:

Customers’ privacy is our top priority. When we noticed the issue, our R&D team investigated the issue immediately, and released the firmware update for the specific NVR at once. The firmware update is now available on our ANNKE official online store and we have announced the update on our forum. We understand how important our customers’ privacy is. Our R&D team has done detailed testing to ensure the firmware fixed the issue.

Security teams will need to continue and possibly expand their plans to secure remote personal devices operating in a hostile environment perhaps indefinitely.

Much of this security can be achieved by policy and product – but user behavior can undermine policy; and user behavior in the home environment is an unknown quantity. SecurityAdvisor, a firm that delivers personalized and continuous awareness training, seeks to better understand human behavior at home in a new study (PDF) titled, Top Riskiest Behaviors and Employees in a Hybrid Workplace.

The firm analyzed more than 500,000 malicious emails and more than 500,000 visits to dangerous websites from staff ranging from entry-level to executive in more than 20 countries. The top five ‘risky behaviors’ are: failing authentication; clicking on phishing emails; installing adware; using P2P software and private VPNs; and streaming pirated content.

Failing authentication may not seem a huge security problem since it demonstrates that access controls are working. However, the volume puts an unnecessary strain on the security team – repeated failure in MFA authentication makes it difficult to distinguish between human error and malicious activity. Fifty percent of home workers fail MFA at least once per month.

Falling for phishing is the most obvious threat to home workers – and the statistics are disturbing. While 99% of spam and phishing emails are caught by filters, 1% still reach in-boxes – leading to an average of 5 phishing emails received by every employee every month. About 8% of these are clicked on. “In a 5,000-employee organization,” says the report, “this equates to 20 phishing emails opened and clicked each month.”

Three to four percent of employees install adware by installing untrusted software online. “Without users' consent or knowledge,” states the report, “the download will include additional software containing adware that can spy and export data to malicious entities.”

Around 5% of employees install P2P software and private VPNs, such as BitTorrent and Golden Frog, to bypass media paywalls, access content in restricted geographies, and download movies without being recognized. SecurityAdvisor considers this a major risk. It suggests that 38% of private VPNs contain malware, while 82% can read their clients’ data.

Around 1% of employees use sites like Putlocker, VidCloud, or 123movies to stream pirated content. “These sites,” warns SecurityAdvisor, “often are hotbeds for malware, ransomware, and keyloggers, which can even auto-install malicious software onto users’ laptops with just one click.”

The analysis also shows that senior management is more likely to be targeted by cybercriminals than the average employee. Senior managers and the C-suite are targeted by phishers almost 50 times more frequently than average employees.

The analysis shows a vast difference in risky behaviors between men and women: 76% of risky users are men, and only 24% are women (this figure accounts for the difference in absolute numbers between men and women employees). There have been many studies that suggest women are more risk averse than men – one this year by the Harvard Business Review suggests that companies with a strong female presence in senior management are more likely to expand through internal R&D, while companies with a strong masculine presence are more likely to engage in the more ‘aggressive’ pursuit of an M&A route. But the reason remains elusive.

This issue is wider than just risky behavior, and may play into the difficulty in persuading young girls to look for a career in technology – which in turn may exacerbate the ‘skills gap’ in technology in general and cybersecurity in particular. So far, however, studies have recognized the difference in behavior without finding any fundamental difference in male/female psychology or biology to explain it. The result is that many people believe the cause and solution falls upon the education system.

SecurityAdvisor talked to Professor Kellie McElhaney, a distinguished teaching fellow and founding director of Berkeley University’s Center for Equity, Gender, and Leadership (EGAL), for further insight into its gender results. McElhaney does not believe that women are naturally any more risk averse than men; but that the behavior is learned over time.

The report suggests that women are more aware of the long-term ramifications of risky behavior. “Men, on the other hand, look at risk as a game,” says the report. “They are trained at an early age to win at all costs and, when threatened with a loss or negative outcome, they will do whatever they can to turn that potential loss into a win. The reason for this is that the penalties for taking a risk and failing are far less severe for men than they are for women – or anyone else who is not a part of the dominant group in a society.”

This is, very simplistically, McElhaney’s view: that behavioral differences between men and women are developed by nurture rather than originating in nature. Nurture begins much earlier than schooling. The implication is that basic attitudes are set before school education begins – and while education can influence these attitudes, changing them will always be an uphill battle. In short, the behavioral differences between men and women are caused by parental and societal expectations above formal education.

A fully managed NoSQL database, Cosmos DB was launched in 2017, for use with web and mobile applications, but also supports modeling social interactions and integration with third-party services.

Earlier this month, researchers with the cloud security firm Wiz discovered a vulnerability in the Azure cloud platform that could allow a remote attacker to take over Cosmos DB instances without authorization, with full administrative rights, meaning they could read, write, or delete databases.

“The vulnerability has a trivial exploit that doesn't require any previous access to the target environment, and impacts thousands of organizations, including numerous Fortune 500 companies,” the researchers, who named the vulnerability ChaosDB, say.

By exploiting security holes in the Jupyter Notebook feature of Cosmos DB, an attacker could obtain valid credentials for the Cosmos DB account, Jupyter Notebook Storage account, and Jupyter Notebook compute.

The issue was reported to Microsoft on August 12 and the vulnerable feature was disabled within 48 hours. However, the vulnerability was exploitable for months prior to being reported and Cosmos DB customers should assume they were exposed, Wiz says.

In fact, Microsoft has already started informing customers of the issue, confirming that it could be exploited to “potentially allow a user to gain access to another customer's resources by using the account's primary read-write key.”

The tech giant notes that only the researchers appear to have exploited the vulnerability to gain access to the primary read-write key (the Cosmos DB Primary Keys), but the company does advise customers to regenerate the keys to ensure they remain secure. Microsoft also says that it isn’t aware of the vulnerability being exploited for data access.

“Microsoft notified only customers that were affected during our short research period (around a week). We think the actual number of potentially impacted customers is much larger and probably includes the majority of Cosmos DB customers, as the vulnerability has been present for months,” Wiz’ researchers say.

Technical details on the vulnerability aren’t being disclosed at this time, but the researchers published a proof-of-concept video to showcase it. Wiz says Microsoft awarded a $40,000 bug bounty reward for the discovery.

Active since at least 2016, FIN8 made a reputation for itself with the targeting of point-of-sale systems, but appears to have strengthened its portfolio with a more potent utility.

Referred to as Sardonic, the new piece of malware consists of several components, including the backdoor itself, a loader, and some scripts. Still under development, Sardonic was observed in-the-wild with its components compiled just before launch, Bitdefender says.

FIN8 is known for the use of spear-phishing and social engineering tactics for initial access to a victim’s network, and the same might have been used in this attack as well. Next, the adversary performs reconnaissance and lateral movement, complemented by privilege escalation.

The attackers used the BADHATCH loader during these stages, and then attempted to deploy the Sardonic backdoor on domain controllers to further spread onto the network.

[ READ: New Version of ShellTea Backdoor Used by FIN8 Hacking Group ]

Deployment begins with running the Sardonic loader, most likely as part of a manual process. The loader would achieve persistence using WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation). However, Bitdefender notes that it doe not attempt persistence, but to ensure the next stage is executed at startup, which in turn executes shellcode responsible for fetching and running the Sardonic backdoor.

Written in C++, the malware can gather system information, execute supplied commands, and can also load crafted DLLs and execute their functions, courtesy of a plugin system meant to expand its capabilities.

During its analysis of Sardonic, Bitdefender also identified a series of commands for which execution hasn’t been implemented, although the binary protocol parsing exists, which suggests that the project is still under development.

FIN8, Bitdefender points out, is known for taking breaks to refine its portfolio and techniques, and the new backdoor shows that the threat actor continues to strengthen its capabilities. Thus, organizations in sectors such as finance, hospitality, and retail, which are preferred FIN8 targets, should continuously scan their environments for potential compromise, the researchers say.

The SANS 2021 OT/ICS Cybersecurity Report is based on information provided by 480 individuals from a wide range of industries.

The survey conducted by SANS showed that nearly 70% of respondents believe the risk to their OT environment is high or severe, which is a significant increase from the 51% in 2019, when SANS conducted a similar survey.

While many organizations are concerned about cyber threats to their OT environments, SANS found that 48% of respondents don’t know whether they have experienced a security breach involving OT or control systems in the past year, an increase from the 42% that gave the same response in 2019. This indicates a need for organizations to improve their detection and response capabilities.

Only 12% are confident their systems have not been compromised, and 15% have admitted detecting security incidents, many of which caused some form of disruption to operations.

A majority of respondents blamed incidents on “hackers,” followed by organized crime, service providers and contractors, employees, activists, and state-sponsored threat actors.

When it comes to initial attack vectors involved in the incidents they have experienced, the top answer was external remote services (36%), followed by exploitation of public-facing applications (32%), internet-accessible devices (28%), spear phishing (26%), removable media (24%), and compromised engineering workstations (18%).

“Of particular concern is the 18% of initial vectors leveraging the engineering workstation,” the authors of the report noted. “This percentage raises some concern because engineering workstations represent key terrain to accomplish a variety of effects in stage 2 of the ICS Cyber Kill Chain and could have contributed to the high numbers of incidents with impact on processes.”

Stage 2 of the ICS Cyber Kill Chain refers to the development and execution of an attack using knowledge acquired in the first stage.

More than 50% of respondents named engineering systems as posing the greatest risk for getting compromised.

As for the steps they have taken over the past years to improve their OT security posture, nearly half of organizations have increased their ICS security budget, and more than two-thirds now have a security monitoring program in place.

More than half claim they are now able to detect an incident within 24 hours, up from 34% in 2019.

In terms of cloud adoption, while only 1% of respondents said they use cloud-based services for OT or ICS systems, nearly all are using cloud technologies to directly support industrial operations.

Tracked as CVE-2021-1577 (CVSS score of 9.1), the issue exists because of improper access control. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability to upload files to an affected device, gaining the ability to read or write arbitrary files.

There are no workarounds to address the vulnerability. However, the company did release patches for versions 3.2, 4.2, and 5.1 of Cisco APIC and Cloud APIC, encouraging customers to apply them as soon as possible, or to migrate to a patched release.

Cisco also released patches for two high-severity bugs in APIC and Cloud APIC, both of which could be exploited to escalate privileges on an affected system.

Three medium-severity issues -- a stored cross-site scripting, a command injection and a file upload issue -- were also addressed in APIC and Cloud APIC.

APIC is one of the main components of Cisco’s Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) software-defined networking solution for data centers.

Additionally, the company patched two high-severity vulnerabilities in NX-OS software, and two in Nexus 9000 series fabric switches, all leading to denial of service (DoS). Various other medium-severity flaws were also patched this week.

None of these vulnerabilities appears to be exploited in the wild, Cisco says. Information on all bugs is available on Cisco’s security portal.

In an update to an advisory published last week, Cisco reveals that it has concluded its investigation into whether its devices are impacted by the BadAlloc flaw that BlackBerry confirmed last week to affect specific QNX releases.

“Cisco has completed its investigation into its product line to determine which products may be affected by this vulnerability. No products are known to be affected,” Cisco says.

One of the first major films to be postponed due to the pandemic was No Time to Die, Daniel Craig's final outing as 007. Originally slated for an April 2020 release, the film was first postponed until November 2020 and then delayed again until April 2021. While some theaters remain closed around the world, MGM is sticking with its latest release dates: a world premiere at Royal Albert Hall in London on September 28, 2021, followed by a general release on September 30 in the UK and October 8 in the US. And the studio has released one last trailer to remind audiences that yes, this premiere is finally happening.

(Spoilers for the 2015 film Spectre below.)

As we've reported previously, this 25th installment in the franchise is co-produced by MGM and Eon Productions, with United Artists and Universal serving as distributors in North America and internationally, respectively. Directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga (True Detective, Beast of No Nation), the film takes place about five years after the capture of Spectre's archvillain Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Christoph Waltz), a criminal mastermind and head of the organization SPECTRE. (Ian Fleming's original character inspired Dr. Evil and his cat, Mr. Bigglesworth, in the Austin Powers film series.)

Spectre sees Bond being suspended from MI6 after carrying out an unauthorized mission to stop a terrorist bombing in Mexico City—based on a posthumous message from Judi Dench's late, lamented M. The new M (Ralph Fiennes) finds his agency in competition with a rival, privately backed intelligence service led by C (Andrew Scott).

Things get complicated, as they always do, leading to a showdown between Bond and Blofeld, who is behind an attempt to infiltrate a planned global intelligence surveillance system so that SPECTRE can access information about any investigations into its criminal activities. (In an unusual twist, Blofeld turns out to be Bond's foster-brother.) The film ends with Blofeld captured and Bond driving off into the sunset with his romantic interest, psychiatrist Madeleine Swann (Lea Seydoux).

Danny Boyle (Sunshine) was originally supposed to direct No Time to Die, but he left early in production due to the usual ""creative differences."" He was replaced by Cary Joji Fukunaga, best known for directing the war drama Beasts of No Nation (2015) and the critically acclaimed first season of True Detective. The film is expected to wrap up several loose narrative threads from the prior Bond films starring Craig, including the loss of Vesper (Eve Green), his love interest from Casino Royale. Per the official synopsis:

In No Time to Die, Bond has left active service and is enjoying a tranquil life in Jamaica. His peace is short-lived when his old friend Felix Leiter (Jeffrey Wright) from the CIA turns up asking for help. The mission to rescue a kidnapped scientist turns out to be far more treacherous than expected, leading Bond onto the trail of a mysterious villain armed with dangerous new technology.

Seydoux reprises her role as Madeleine Swann, and Waltz returns as Blofeld, currently imprisoned but obviously still plotting against Bond and the world in general. Other returning cast members include Ben Whishaw as Q, Naomie Harris as Eve Moneypenny, Rory Kinnear as M's chief of staff Bill Tanner, and Ralph Fiennes as M. New characters include Rami Malek as the archvillain Safin, described by the director as a ""hyper intelligent and worthy adversary"" for Bond; Lashana Lynch as Nomi, a new ""00"" agent who joined MI6 following Bond's assumed retirement; Ana de Armas as Paloma, a CIA agent assigned to help Bond; and David Dencik as Valdo Obruchev, a scientist who has disappeared, prompting Bond's return to the field to investigate.

There's an almost elegiac quality to the opening of this final trailer, as we flash back to the beginning of Casino Royale, when Bond becomes, well, Bond, earning his 007 status after taking out a bad guy in a bathroom. Bond acknowledges that ""00s"" have a very short life expectancy as we see a few quick shots of past missions. There's also a shot of that devastating moment when Bond finds Vesper's drowned body—the defining heartbreak of his life (so far). ""Every mission, every sacrifice has led to this,"" the text announces, culminating in our first glimpse of Safin in his trademark Noh-inspired mask.

While No Time to Die opens five years after Spectre, with Bond and Swann enjoying domestic bliss, no Bond gets to live happily ever after. As the trailer makes clear, Swann has her own secrets, and Blofeld and Safin know all about her. (""When her secret finds its way out, it will be the death of him,"" Blofeld gloats from his cell.) As for the villainous plot threatening the world, ""We used to be able to get into a room with the enemy,"" Fiennes' M says, lamenting the fact that evildoers are now largely operating ""in the ether."" That ephemeral aspect seems to play a role in Blofeld/Safin's nefarious scheme. ""Target enough people..."" Q says. ""And the people become the weapon,"" Bond concludes.

And of course, we've got all the exotic locations, beautiful women, and trademark Aston Martins one could ask for in a Bond film. The latter include the classic DB5, now avec miniguns, as well as a DBS and what may have been a 1980s-era Vantage in the first trailer released last December. The film also reportedly features one of Aston Martin's brand-new midengined hybrid hypercars, the Valhalla, developed in conjunction with legendary F1 aerodynamicist Adrian Newey, as Ars' Jonathan Gitlin reported last year.

No Time To Die opens exclusively in theaters on September 30, 2021, in the UK, and on October 8, 2021, in the US.

The reversion is the product of the Trump administration's haste to get rid of Obama-era regulations, leading to action that produced rules running counter to the Environmental Protection Agency's own scientific findings. As a result, a judge has decided that the rules cannot remain in place for the time that will be needed for the Biden administration to formulate replacements.

Defining water

The long-running saga is the product of the Clean Water Act's remarkably vague protections. The act seeks to control pollution via a permitting process that applies to the “waters of the United States,"" but it doesn't define what constitutes said waters.

While the process would clearly apply to a flowing river, it's less clear whether the act would regulate the pollution of a stream bed only filled seasonally or following heavy rains—even though the stream bed can flow directly into a river that is active year-round. Similar issues apply to items like man-made ponds that connect to other bodies via groundwater flow.

In the absence of a clear definition in the statute itself, the relevant agency—in this case, the EPA—has been left to define what is regulated via a federal rule-making process. During the Obama administration, the EPA recognized that the then-active rules, which dated from 1986, were unpopular with both businesses and environmentalists and were increasingly out of step with our scientific understanding of the role of groundwater and seasonal bodies of water. So the agency began the process of formulating new rules, which required proposing them, soliciting public feedback, and modifying the rules in response.

The rules, finalized near the end of Obama's second term, covered a wider range of small bodies of water and wetlands. This outcome proved highly unpopular with business interests, which tied up the rules' adoption in court long enough for President Trump to withdraw them in order to formulate his own.

On again, off again

Trump's EPA ultimately produced the Navigable Waters Protection Rule, which went into effect near the end of Trump's time in office. This rule largely reversed the changes made by the previous administration, removing permit requirements for things like man-made channels, groundwater, and stream beds that only fill following rains. The draft version of the Navigable Waters Protection Rule was specifically criticized by the EPA's own science advisory board as ignoring our current scientific understanding and being incompatible with the aims of the Clean Water Act.

So it was no surprise that this rule also ended up in court, with one case involving Native American tribes in the Southwest, where many bodies of water are only active following rainfall. And once again, with the change in administration, the Biden EPA asked the court to suspend the case while it formulated a replacement for the Navigable Waters Protection Rule. In the meantime, however, the administration asked the court to allow the rule to remain in place to prevent things from reverting to the definition that dates back to the 1980s.

And that's where the new decision from US District Judge Rosemary Márquez was needed. The Tribal plaintiffs asked that the judge accept the suspension of the case but vacate the Navigable Waters Protection Rule in the process, reverting things to the post-1986 status quo. They argued that leaving the rule in place risked irreparable harms to the watercourses in their area of the country.

How to decide?

Márquez determined there were several reasons that the Navigable Waters Protection Rule would have to go. For example, precedent indicated that ""an agency conclusion that is in direct conflict with the conclusion of its own experts... is arbitrary and capricious,"" and arbitrary and capricious rules violate the Administrative Procedure Act that governs federal rulemaking. And, as indicated by the EPA's science advisory board, this rule was clearly in conflict with the opinions of the EPA's own experts.

Accordingly, the rule could not be fixed by simply providing a better legal justification; Márquez said that the rule needed to be thrown out and rewritten, a process the Biden administration had already indicated it intends to engage in.

The decision about whether to retain the rule in the meantime is determined by whether its flaws would enable harm during the time in which it's being replaced. And here, the plaintiffs made a strong case that harm would come. They noted that the federal government itself has identified over 300 projects that would have required permits under the Obama-era rules but not under the Trump version. In New Mexico and Arizona, where the Tribes are located, the vast majority of the 1,500 streams would not require permits under the Navigable Waters Protection Rule.

Overall, when it comes to revoking the rule, Márquez concluded that ""the seriousness of the Agencies' errors in enacting the Navigable Waters Protection Rule, the likelihood that the Agencies will alter the Navigable Waters Protection Rule's definition of 'waters of the United States,' and the possibility of serious environmental harm if the Navigable Waters Protection Rule remains in place upon remand, all weigh in favor.""

Unless the case is appealed, that's the end of the Navigable Waters Protection Rule. Over the course of the last five years, businesses have had to deal with three separate standards for determining whether permits are needed—with one of them being in force two different times. And within the next two years, a new rule will be formulated and put on hold while court cases are filed."

Reddit allows “dissent” from vaccine consensus

Last week, the moderators of over 450 subreddits joined an open letter urging Reddit to ""take action against the rampant Coronavirus misinformation on their website,"" saying that subreddits existing ""solely to spread medical disinformation and undermine efforts to combat the global pandemic should be banned.""

Reddit published a response defending its stance, saying it will continue to allow ""debate"" and ""dissent"" on vaccines and other COVID-related matters even when it ""challenge[s] consensus views.""

""We appreciate that not everyone agrees with the current approach to getting us all through the pandemic, and some are still wary of vaccinations. Dissent is a part of Reddit and the foundation of democracy,"" the company said.

Reddit does draw a line somewhere, as it said it will continue to take action against communities ""dedicated to fraud (e.g. fake vaccine cards) or encouraging harm (e.g. consuming bleach)."" But in general, Reddit said, ""we believe it is best to enable communities to engage in debate and dissent, and for us to link to the CDC wherever appropriate.""

We contacted Reddit today, and a spokesperson said the company has nothing to say in addition to last week's statement.

A few weeks ago, Reddit quarantined r/NoNewNormal, where anti-mask and anti-vaccine posts are common. Users can still go to that subreddit after viewing a message that advises ""consult[ing] your physician"" for medical advice and points to information on vaccines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Moderators protesting Reddit policies say the company has done ""nothing of substance"" other than quarantining that one subreddit.

""We could have been better off months ago, but disinformation and lies have been allowed to spread readily through inaction and malice, and have dragged this on at the cost of lives,"" the open letter said. ""There are those who deny that the pandemic even exists, there are those who think that wearing a mask will literally suffocate you, there are those who think it's no worse than a regular flu virus, that it's a bioweapon, and everything in between. This volume of blatant misinformation is problematic and dangerous.""

Bose on Tuesday announced its latest set of wireless noise-canceling headphones, the QuietComfort 45.

The new headphones cost $330 and are up for preorder today, with shipping to begin on September 23.

A familiar design

The QuietComfort line has proven popular for Bose over the years, so it may not be a surprise to see that the QuietComfort 45 does not significantly diverge from its predecessor, the QuietComfort 35 II, which launched roughly four years ago.

Their design follows closely in the footsteps of that older pair, with some minor changes to smooth out the look of the sides and ear cushions but a similarly understated aesthetic on the whole. There are still physical control buttons for adjusting volume, controlling playback and noise cancellation, and taking calls, but thankfully, the older microUSB port has been replaced by USB-C. Bose continues to use a 2.5 mm connector instead of the more universal 3.5 mm jack for wired listening, though it does include a 3.5 mm to 2.5 mm cable in the box if needed. The headphones are available in either a black or “white smoke” finish.

In general, the largely plastic construction of the QuietComfort 35 II didn't make for the most premium-feeling package in the world, particularly for headphones selling for north of $300. The headphones were exceptionally comfortable, however, with a lightweight design that didn’t clamp down too tightly and folded up neatly for easier storage. We’ve yet to get our hands on the QuietComfort 45, but from images, the fit looks like it will be similar.

Bose isn’t touting any major changes to sound quality. For reference, the QuietComfort 35 IIs had a relatively balanced sound with a slight bass boost. Like most premium wireless headphones, they were far from the clearest or most detailed headphones you could get for the money, but they were mellow-sounding and largely inoffensive to most non-audiophile listeners. Again, we’ll have to test out the new pair for ourselves to see if anything has changed.

Noise canceling, battery life, and Bluetooth

The main reason people buy QuietComforts—aside from good marketing—is Bose’s active noise cancellation (ANC) tech, which has consistently ranked among the most effective on the market. Here, Bose says it’s using a “new electronics package” to help the QuietComfort 45 better sense and eliminate mid-range frequencies than before.

There are now two different noise-canceling “modes” as well: a “Quiet” mode for traditional active noise cancellation and an “Aware” mode that seems to work similarly to the “ambient sound” modes found on competing headphones. This latter mode lets you hear noise from the outside world alongside whatever you’re playing. You can swap between these modes through a button on the left earcup. (This button also lets you mute your mic during phone calls.) There does not appear to be a way to adjust the strength of the noise-canceling effect beyond this setting, however. Bose’s other wireless noise cancelers, the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 , let you turn the ANC up or down on a 10-point scale, for instance.

Bose is also touting improved call quality, aided in part by the addition of another microphone to the beamforming mic array built into the headphones. The QuietComfort 35 IIs were not bad in this regard, but this was an area where the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 made improvements, so any upgrade would be welcome, particularly with more and more people taking their work calls at home.

The company claims that the QuietComfort 45s will last up to 24 hours on a charge. This is a step up from the 20-hour battery life of the QuietComfort 35 IIs, though it would still fall short of rivals like Sony’s WH-1000XM4, whose battery can last more than 30 hours. Bose says you can get three hours of playback from a 15-minute charge.

Entering into a crowded market

The headphones connect over Bluetooth 5.1 and have a rated Bluetooth range of up to 30 feet. The latter is common, and the QuietComfort 35 IIs were not known to have significant wireless connectivity issues, though it’s worth noting that competitors like Apple’s AirPods Max use a Class 1 Bluetooth radio that helps them hold a signal over wider ranges. Like their predecessors, the QuietComfort 45s can also maintain a connection with two devices simultaneously, so you can listen to music on a PC but quickly swap to your phone to take a call without having to go through the usual Bluetooth-pairing rigmarole.

Bose will discontinue the QuietComfort 35 II with the launch of the QuietComfort 45, but it will continue to sell the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, which launched just over two years ago and will still cost $50 more at $379. Compared to the QuietComfort 35 II, the 700s offer a more premium-feeling metal design, a more granular ANC control and superior call quality, and a slightly more bass-heavy sound profile. At maximum, the 700s' ANC is generally just as strong, though we’ll have to see if the QuietComfort 45s can outmatch the older pair.

That said, the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 don’t fold up, they're a bit heavier on the head (for me, at least), their battery life is still rated at 20 hours per charge, and they're more heavily reliant on Bose’s Music app to access many features, even requiring you to create a Bose account to use the app in the first place. They also rely on touch controls for managing volume and playback; the controls generally work well, but some may find physical buttons preferable.

The most frequently recommended option in this market, and my personal favorite after testing numerous sets over the past year, is the Sony WH-1000XM4, which has similarly excellent ANC, a well-padded design, longer battery life, a sound profile that’s more bass-heavy by default but can be customized depending on your preferences (the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 also have a custom EQ tool), multi-point connectivity, and useful bonus features like a “speak to chat” function that can automatically pause your music when you’re talking to someone. They also use touch controls, though, and the QuietComfort 45s will come in at about $20 below Sony’s $349 MSRP —though the XM4s have regularly gone on sale for less than that over the past few months.

Apple’s AirPods Max, meanwhile, have stronger noise cancellation, a more detailed sound, and a clearer transparency mode than any other wireless headphones we’ve tested to date. You can also have Apple replace the set's battery down the line, albeit for a $79 fee. That said, the headphones don’t fold, you can’t listen over a cable, and they don’t have a power button, instead relying on a proprietary and largely unprotective case to enter a low-power mode. They also carry an MSRP of $549, which continues to be a tough sell for non-Apple-diehards when Sony's and Bose’s pairs offer close-enough functionality for much less.

The QuietComfort 45 isn’t rocking the boat too hard, but ditching the microUSB port is a good start, and if Bose’s claimed improvements to noise cancellation and call quality hold up, the new pair could be worth a shot for those interested in a premium pair of wireless noise-canceling headphones. We will try to get a pair in for review and let you know for sure in the coming weeks.

Driven by her phobia of needles, Holmes wanted to create diagnostic tests that use blood from finger pricks rather than from needles.
Problematic claimsFor many tests, blood from finger pricks is difficult to analyze.
Yet Holmes and Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, Theranos’ president and chief operating officer, painted a rosy picture for investors, partners, and customers.
Both Holmes and Balwani have pleaded not guilty, and Balwani’s trial will begin next year.","Nearly a decade ago, Theranos touted a revolutionary diagnostic device that could run myriad medical tests without having to draw blood through a needle. Today, the startup’s founder, Elizabeth Holmes, goes to court, where she’s facing 12 criminal counts for statements she made to investors and consumers about her company’s technology.

Holmes founded Theranos in 2003 after dropping out of Stanford University at the age of 19. Driven by her phobia of needles, Holmes wanted to create diagnostic tests that use blood from finger pricks rather than from needles. The idea caught on, attracting well-connected board members like Henry Kissinger and James Mattis, drawing over $400 million in investments from wealthy investors including Larry Ellison and Rupert Murdoch, and securing lucrative partnerships with Walgreens and Safeway. At its peak, Theranos was worth over $9 billion.

But Theranos’ myth started unwinding in 2015 when a Wall Street Journal investigation revealed that the company had been performing most of its tests on traditional blood diagnostic machines rather than its own “Einstein” device. The company’s own employees doubted the machine’s accuracy.

Problematic claims

For many tests, blood from finger pricks is difficult to analyze. Small amounts of blood typically contain more variability than larger draws from veins, and a poorly executed stick might grab interstitial fluid along with the blood. Plus, finger-prick blood comes in contact with the skin, raising the chances of contamination that can confound the results. Yet Holmes and Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani, Theranos’ president and chief operating officer, painted a rosy picture for investors, partners, and customers.

“Theranos claimed that its laboratory infrastructure yielded test results in less time than conventional labs—requiring hours instead of days. Theranos claimed that its proprietary technology and methods would minimize the risk of human error and generate results with the highest accuracy,” the indictment says. Despite this, prosecutors have said, “Holmes and Balwani knew that the analyzer had accuracy and reliability problems, performed a limited number of tests, was slower than some competing devices, and, in some respects, could not compete with existing, more conventional machines.”

Holmes and Balwani were indicted in June 2018, and soon Theranos was facing mounting civil and criminal investigations. The company settled a Securities and Exchange Commission probe and shut down shortly thereafter.

The end of Theranos didn’t halt the scrutiny of Holmes' and Balwani’s behavior, though. Three rounds of indictments have brought the total to 10 counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. The latest indictment, which supersedes the previous two, was filed in June 2020.

Both Holmes and Balwani have pleaded not guilty, and Balwani’s trial will begin next year.

The indictments aren’t limited to claims about the company’s proprietary diagnostic machine but also include what Holmes and Balwani allegedly said to investors about revenue and business deals. The prosecution says the pair told investors that Theranos would bring in over $100 million in revenue in 2014, helping the company break even, and hit $1 billion in 2015, amounts that exceeded the executives' actual expectations. Prosecutors also say that the pair falsely told investors that the company landed contracts with the Pentagon.

Delayed trial

The road to trial has been filled with delays, first due to the COVID-19 pandemic and then again when Holmes became pregnant. Her child was born in July, around the time the trial was supposed to begin. If convicted, Holmes faces up to 20 years in prison.

Today’s proceedings kick off jury selection, in which prosecutors and defense attorneys will begin questioning over 100 potential jurors. The pool was already slashed last week, as Holmes’ attorney Kevin Downey told US District Judge Edward Davila of the Northern District of California that more than 30 jurors had “consumed substantial—and I mean lengthy, extrajudicial—material about the case and about the defendant."" In a pre-trial hearing , Downey also said that selected jurors must be vaccinated, while the prosecution wouldn’t commit to a stance on the issue.

Opening statements are scheduled to begin on September 8, and the trial may run through mid-December. Holmes is expected to claim that Balwani, who was her boyfriend for much of Theranos’ existence, was an abusive and controlling partner. A court filing released on Saturday revealed that Holmes is expected to take the stand during the trial and allege that he monitored her calls, texts, and emails and was physically violent, claims that Balwani denies. Her attorneys say these actions affected her “state of mind” when the alleged fraud took place."

In the US, Google is being sued by 36 states, and some states are considering passing their own app store rules.
Epic, Spotify, MatchGroup (the owners of Tinder), and several other app developers have formed the “Coalition for App Fairness” advocacy group to push back against exorbitant app store fees.","South Korea will soon pass a law banning Apple's and Google's app store payment requirements. An amendment to South Korea’s Telecommunications Business Act will stop app store owners from requiring developers to use in-house payment systems. The law also bans app store owners from unreasonably delaying the approval of apps or deleting them from the marketplace, which the country fears is used as a method of retaliation. As The Wall Street Journal reports, the law has passed South Korea's National Assembly (the country's Congress equivalent), and President Moon Jae-in is expected to sign the bill into law.

In the rest of the world, Apple and Google get a 30 percent cut of most app purchases, in-app sales, and subscriptions, and the companies don't allow developers to use alternative payment options. Once the bill passes in South Korea, app developers will be free to search for a payments provider that offers them the best deal. Google's and Apple's stores do provide some benefits, like user authentication for purchases, friction-free purchases thanks to stored payment information, and easy data hosting and distribution for digital goods. If developers don't need any of those things or are willing to roll their own solutions, standard credit card processors usually only take a 1-3 percent cut of sales.

The Verge received statements from both Google and Apple. A Google spokesperson told the site, “Just as it costs developers money to build an app, it costs us money to build and maintain an operating system and app store. We’ll reflect on how to comply with this law while maintaining a model that supports a high-quality operating system and app store, and we will share more in the coming weeks.""

Apple touted the safety of its locked-down ecosystem, saying, ""The proposed Telecommunications Business Act will put users who purchase digital goods from other sources at risk of fraud, undermine their privacy protections, make it difficult to manage their purchases, and features like “Ask to Buy” and Parental Controls will become less effective. We believe user trust in App Store purchases will decrease as a result of this proposal—leading to fewer opportunities for the over 482,000 registered developers in Korea who have earned more than KRW8.55 trillion to date with Apple.""

Neither Google nor Apple provides exact app store revenue numbers, but analytics firm Sensor Tower estimates that the App Store facilitated $72.3 billion in global spending in 2020, while Google Play did $38.6 billion. In South Korea, Samsung dominates the smartphone market (and a bunch of other markets—Samsung is around 10-20 percent of South Korea's GDP) with 67 percent market share in Q1 2021, according to Counterpoint Research . Apple picks up most of the rest with 22 percent. In third place, with 10 percent market share, is another Korean company, LG, which quit the smartphone market in July 2021. With such a focus on Android, the bill has apparently been nicknamed the ""anti-Google law"" in South Korea.

The South Korean law is the latest strike against Google's and Apple's app stores. Epic Games, the company behind the hit game Fortnite and the Unreal Engine, has been battling Google's and Apple's app store rules around the world, either with lawsuits or through talks with regulators. In the US, Google is being sued by 36 states, and some states are considering passing their own app store rules. Epic, Spotify, MatchGroup (the owners of Tinder), and several other app developers have formed the “Coalition for App Fairness” advocacy group to push back against exorbitant app store fees."

This kind of access differs from the carefully selected ""slices"" we sometimes play in preview events, as those are meant to show an unfinished game in its best light.

But after going hands-on with Far Cry 6 for nearly four hours, I was reminded why game studios are sometimes cagey about prerelease reveals.

The demo I played was equal parts massive and unwieldy. I couldn't help but feel like hundreds of Ubisoft staffers' efforts to create a beautiful and convincing pseudo-Cuban adventure wound up squeezed into a single, tiny clown car of a package. The issues didn't end with game-breaking bugs and wonky AI, which may very well be resolved on, erm, October 7. At this point, I'm more concerned about uninspiring new loadout systems, a narrative tone that can't make up its mind, and an absolute yawn of a return to the Ubisoft open-world bloat of old.

Yara mean one, Mr. Esposito

For the uninitiated: every new Far Cry game, much like games in the Final Fantasy series, changes the location and characters while otherwise sticking to a familiar gameplay core. In FC6's case, that's open-world, first-person gunplay. Players must typically move by foot, four-wheeler, boat, or other modes of transport between massive forests, expansive shorelines, and run-down cities, all while battling whatever megalomaniacal leader is dominating said remote locale.

















This time, the setting is Yara, which is a thinly veiled fictional Cuba, and its megalomaniac is Antón Castillo, portrayed by beloved actor Giancarlo Esposito (Breaking Bad). Over the years of his reign, Castillo has converted his island nation into a massive research and pharmaceutical laboratory, and he is so set on selling a cancer-beating cure to the rest of the world that his regime forces locals to work his farms and labs as unpaid slaves—or be killed for resisting. You start the game as Dani, a born-and-raised ""Yaran"" who questions this leadership approach and joins a rebellion.

The game immediately lands on the wrong foot in terms of tone. While Far Cry games' villains haven't necessarily been the epitome of nuance, Castillo is easily the series' corniest one yet, saved (almost) by Esposito's adept performance. To the plot's credit, we've been fast-forwarded to the part of the story where Castillo has tricked enough of the party faithful into aligning with his murderous regime—you don't have to look far in history books to see how accurately that checks—but FC6's plot-filled opening has no interest in establishing how Castillo ever became beloved. His valuation of all other civilians' lives is comically nil.

Meanwhile, everything posed from Dani's perspective can't make up its mind: should Far Cry 6 be bludgeoningly serious or distractingly cheeky? Harrowing murders and ripped-apart families suggest one extreme, while giddy nihilism and comically large flamethrowers point firmly in the opposite direction. I'm working from a deficit in guessing how the full package plays out, but I already suspect that Esposito's solid acting and legitimacy will continue to get in the way of FC6's hankering to descend into dumb, dumb, dumb.

Yes, you can pet the dogs... with bullets























This is the kind of game, after all, where you'll get seriously hurt in the middle of frenetic machine-gun combat, then tap the ""heal"" button and watch yourself... light and puff a cigar? Because Cuba, I guess? It's also the kind of game where you'll head to an out-of-the-way farm because a ""battle chicken"" you'd just befriended instantly warps about half a mile from your current location. Hop in a car, track the farm down, and help this bird kill a bunch of trained guard dogs over some sort of thinly explained animal spat. To repeat that: you must murder barking dog after barking dog, with very little explanation as to what evils these dogs had ever committed or what nasty names they may have called the chicken's mother.

In my head, I've already started cataloguing every emotionally numb, head-scratching narrative turn I faced in this four-hour demo, and I'm not convinced that explaining each of those beats at length is worth your reading time. It certainly wasn't worth my attention inside the game.

But if you've played previous Far Cry games, you may already assume the narrative-worst with this series and instead hope that this sequel cranks up the massive-island battling opportunities to the point you can mash the ""skip cut scene"" button and have fun anyway. The nicest thing I can say on that front is how pretty, lush, and varied FC6's Cuba-like cities and islands looked in my preview session. Ubisoft's global network of studios has clearly put a ton of work into building Yara's landscapes, and the environs alternate between full forest zones, roadside encampments, boozy shoreline towns, castle-like fortresses, and more.

These are even more fun to explore when you commandeer a car, horse, biplane, or helicopter to tread ground more quickly, though FC6 has many unsurprising ""finish a quest before exploring freely"" road bumps in place. Some road checkpoints will slash your car's or bike's tires if you try to drive through, and anti-air turrets will blow unexpected aircraft out of the sky mighty quickly. Kill all of the guards at any of these pesky anti-rebel encampments to drive or fly through freely."

Colorado-based Lightning eMotors, which we last saw electrifying Transit vans for DHL Express, is now getting into the school bus game, partnering with Collins Bus, a leading manufacturer of the smaller yellow school buses.

The bus uses a Ford E-450 chassis, but instead of a thirsty V6, V8, or V10, Lightning supplies a 396 hp (295 kW), 878 lb-ft (1,190 Nm) electric motor, fed by a 127-kWh battery pack. AC charging is a bit more powerful than most passenger electric vehicles, at 19.2 kW. The buses can also DC fast-charge at 60 kW and will be capable of vehicle-to-grid interactions. The first buses are scheduled for delivery this fall.

""Collins has decades of bus manufacturing experience and is a long-standing leader in Class A school buses, with a well-established and loyal dealer network and customer base,"" said Tim Reeser, CEO of Lightning eMotors. ""We are thrilled that they have selected us to be their EV technology partner. There are nearly half a million school buses in the US that are sitting at peak electric times available to put energy back on the grid, making student transportation a key part in reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions."""

The space agency and its traditional contractors could do the job better than anyone, he said.
And Nelson is no longer a US Senator—he is the administrator of the space agency.","Publicly, NASA is still holding on to the possibility of a 2021 launch date for the debut flight of its Space Launch System rocket. This week, an agency spokesperson told Ars that ""NASA is working toward a launch for the Artemis I mission by the end of this year.""

However, a source said the best-case scenario for launching the Artemis 1 mission is spring of next year, with summer being the more realistic target for a test flight of the heavy lift rocket and Orion spacecraft. The space agency is already running about two months behind internal targets for testing and integrating the rocket at Kennedy Space Center, and the critical pre-flight tests remain ahead.

NASA's Kathryn Hambleton acknowledged that the space agency has seen schedule slips. ""The agency continues to monitor the rise of COVID cases in the Kennedy area, which, combined with other factors such as weather and first time operations, is impacting our schedule of operations,"" she said. ""Moving step by step, we are progressing toward launch while keeping our team as safe as possible.""

Earlier this summer, technicians and engineers in Florida completed stacking the SLS rocket, along with its side boosters. A ""mass simulator"" for Orion was then placed atop the rocket. At present, NASA and its contractors are working on vibration tests of the assembled rocket, with the goal of better understanding the difference between the natural vibrations of the full stack versus those caused by external forces. This information will be fed into flight software.

NASA originally hoped to complete this work in July, but Hambleton confirmed to Ars that this vibration, or ""modal"" testing, is ongoing in the Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy Space Center.

Following this testing, the mass simulator will be removed, and the Orion spacecraft with its launch abort system will be stacked carefully on top of the rocket. This process may take a few weeks. Following this assembly and further tests, the SLS stack will be rolled to Launch Pad 39B for a ""wet dress rehearsal,"" during which the vehicle will be fueled and much of an actual countdown simulated. However, the vehicle's engines will not be fired. A source said this wet-dress test will likely take place in November or December.

Following this test, the vehicle will be rolled back into the Vehicle Assembly Building for final checks and closeouts. Assuming the wet dress rehearsal proceeds nominally and other activities continue on schedule, the SLS rocket could launch next spring. However if there are further delays, or if the wet dress rehearsal identifies new issues, the launch would most likely slip to next summer.

Hambleton said NASA plans to soon offer an update on launch dates. After modal testing and stacking of Orion on top of the rocket, she said the agency will release a projected date for the wet dress rehearsal and the launch of the rocket itself. ""As always, we will fly only when we are ready,"" she said.

Although years late and many billions of dollars over budget, the launch of this rocket will in some ways be a minor miracle. For a large bureaucracy like NASA, completing complex human spaceflight tasks is difficult. And the SLS rocket is complex both technically and politically.

Concerned about job losses after the space shuttle retired, Congress imposed this rocket on the space agency, down to dictating its various components to ensure that space shuttle contractors such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Aerojet Rocketdyne continue to receive substantial space program funding. Each contractor was given a ""cost plus"" contract that ensured funding but provided little incentive for on-time delivery.

The legislation creating the Space Launch System was passed in October 2010, at which time the rocket was expected to be ready for operations in 2016. One of the key legislators behind the rocket's creation was then-Florida-Senator Bill Nelson. He relentlessly fought against the Obama administration's effort to see if private companies, such as United Launch Alliance and SpaceX, could more efficiently build a large rocket for NASA. The space agency and its traditional contractors could do the job better than anyone, he said.

""This rocket is coming in at the cost of what not only what we estimated in the NASA Authorization act, but less,” Nelson said at the time. “The cost of the rocket over a five- to six-year period in the NASA authorization bill was to be no more than $11.5 billion.” Later, he went further, saying, ""If we can't do a rocket for $11.5 billion, we ought to close up shop.""

More than a decade later, NASA has spent more than $20 billion to reach the launch pad. And Nelson is no longer a US Senator—he is the administrator of the space agency. The shop remains open."

In 2009, the national average price of wind power purchase agreements reached a peak of $70 per megawatt-hour.","Wind power isn't the largest part of the United States' energy mix, but it grew over the last year, according to the Wind Technologies Market Report. The renewable energy source grew to more than 8 percent of the country's electricity supply—reaching 10 percent in a growing number of states—and saw a whopping $25 billion in investments in what will translate to 16.8 gigawatts of capacity, according to the report.

Put out by the US Department of Energy, the sizeable report draws upon a variety of data sources for its finding, including government data from the Energy Information Administration, trade data from the US International Trade Commission, and hourly pricing data from the various system operators. “The report itself covers the entire gamut of the US wind industry,” Mark Bolinger, a research scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and one of the authors of the report, told Ars.

Bigger is sometimes better

According to the report, the performance of wind power operations in the US has improved a great deal. We can measure this based on capacity factor, a ratio of the amount of energy a turbine actually produces compared to the amount it could have produced if it ran at its peak constantly. For recently constructed wind power projects, the average capacity factor has now cleared 40 percent. The biggest gains in this area, however, are seen in the US' “wind belt,” a region that receives a large amount of wind, stretching from the Dakotas to Texas.

In large part, this increase is due to longer blades, which allow the turbines to generate more power as they're spun around by the wind. According to the report, in 2010 there were no turbines in the US that had rotors at or above 115 meters in diameter. However, last year, 91 percent of new turbines had rotors of this size or larger. The report also notes that this size is likely to increase.

The towers these rotors are attached to are also getting taller, sometimes along with the increase in blade size. According to Bolinger, this move isn't quite as widespread, but “it is starting to creep up now.”

In the past, there's been a “soft cap” of 500 feet on the total height of the turbines—from the base of the tower to the tip of the blades—because that triggers greater permitting requirements from the Federal Aviation Administration, he said. But with the size of the rotors increasing recently, the size of the towers themselves also needs to increase to avoid having the blades swing too low to the ground. Developers have gotten more comfortable going over 500 feet, he said, adding that some turbines are reaching 700 feet tall. Even besides the practical reason behind it, taller towers also help the turbines generate more energy.

“In general, the winds tend to be stronger at higher altitudes, so this is something that will increase the capacity factor,” he said.

The “wind belt” still sees the vast majority of wind development in the US. However this trend of larger turbines with larger rotors allows wind operators to function quite well in areas that have lower average wind speeds. “That does open up other parts of the country to economical wind development,” he said.

There are larger up-front costs to build these larger turbines, but at a dollar-per-watt basis they end up cheaper. They may be more expensive, but they produce more energy, Bolinger said.

Blowin' in the wind

All of this is making wind power cheaper. In 2009, the national average price of wind power purchase agreements reached a peak of $70 per megawatt-hour. Now, in the “wind belt,” it is around $20 per megawatt-hour and averages around $30 per megawatt-hour in the country's eastern and western regions. “These are at, or near, all-time lows,” Bolinger said, although they include the impact of renewable energy tax breaks.

Wind also gets indirect subsidies, since it requires power lines to get to people. Wind operations tend to be located far away from major population centers. Bolinger said that, to improve the effectiveness of wind power, there should be better incentives to build these lines and more planning involved in building them.

“You need that critical transmission link to move the power from the wind farm to the urban centers where the power can be consumed,” he said.

Wind's growth has come in part due to tax breaks and the willingness to pay the costs of expanding the transmission grids. But it also provides benefits that aren't priced in, either. By displacing fossil fuels, wind power can reduce the emissions of various compounds such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide, among others. Human health and the climate benefit from these reductions. The report estimates that the national average economic benefits for these reductions came to $76 per megawatt-hour generated by wind last year. According to Bolinger, this year's report is the first that includes a segment about the health and environmental benefits of the renewable energy source."

Temptation comes in different forms, especially behind the wheel. With a plug-in hybrid SUV, there are two competing urges. Sometimes, the move is to put it in Sport mode and scream down the highway to take full advantage of the hybrid powertrain. In the case of the Lincoln Aviator, the urge was to ignore the engine altogether, instead relying on electrons rather than hydrocarbons for propulsion. To Lincoln's credit, the Aviator made that an easy choice.

In revamping its SUV lineup, Lincoln has gone hard for big grilles and classic styling, both of which the Aviator has. It sports classic SUV contours, but the slope of the windshield and the tapering top, paired with the Aviator nameplate on the front quarter panels, give it a light art deco vibe. The mid-size, three-row Aviator plugs into Lincoln's lineup between the full-size Navigator and the compact Nautilus

Unfortunately, the Aviator's comfortable interior doesn't show the same level of design elegance. The materials all feel high-quality—there are scads of leather and wood trim—but it's busy. A massive center console makes what should be a spacious front row feel slightly cramped. But the seats are excellent, and both front row occupants can sink into the Aviator's 30-way (!) adjustable seats. The second-row captain’s chairs are roomy and comfortable, but the third row is difficult to get into and is best suited for kids.

Lincoln has eschewed the customary gear shift lever or dial in favor of four buttons mounted near the top of the console, just below the 10-inch, tablet-style infotainment display.

That display runs Sync 4 with a Lincoln-specific skin. Sync 4 is a massive upgrade from its predecessors, but the touchscreen is mounted at the top of the console right between the driver and passenger seats, and it faces the back of the car instead of being angled toward the driver. With no dial, there can be a long reach when you can't accomplish what you want with the steering wheel controls.

Like the Nautilus, the Aviator has a 12-inch digital instrument cluster. It's elegant looking, but driving the car for a week left me with the impression that Lincoln knows that large, digital instrument clusters are a thing—the company just doesn't quite understand how to best utilize them. Our test vehicle also came with a fantastic heads-up display that is easily visible even with polarized sunglasses on. You'll need to add the $7,850 Grand Touring I package to get it, however.

To power the Aviator, Lincoln has paired a 3.0 L twin-turbo V6 with a 100 hp (74.6 kW) electric motor powered by a 13.6 kWh battery. That combination gets you 494 hp (356 kW) and 630 lb-ft (850 Nm) of torque (and a 0 to 60 time of 5.0 seconds). On pure electric power, Lincoln claims a range of 21 miles (33.8 km), which is around what we experienced in our daily usage. With five drive modes, you can pick the driving experience you want. Sport mode wasn't very rewarding—the SUV can get going in a big hurry, but it's more fast than sporty.

Even though there's a Pure EV mode, the Aviator does its best work in Conserve mode, which forces the SUV to mainline electricity whenever possible before switching to chugging gasoline. The gas engine will kick in when rapid acceleration is called for; otherwise, the Aviator is happy to cruise along quietly on battery power for as long as it holds out. We also made a habit of plugging the Aviator in whenever we pulled into the garage. The included 120-volt charger will fully recharge the battery overnight. With a 240 V setup, charging times are slashed by two-thirds. In a nice touch, the Aviator tells you how long it will take to fully charge each time you stop the car (about three hours on a level 2 charger and a bit over nine on 120 V).

With some hybrid SUVs, like the Volvo XC90 Recharge and the Porsche Cayenne E-Hybrid, you need a very gentle right foot, otherwise the engine is going to power up. The Aviator does a better job in this regard—you don't need a feathery touch on the gas pedal in order to reap the benefit of a hybrid. That's really where the Aviator shines. EPA estimates for Lincoln come in at 23 mpg (10.2 L/100 km) for gas-only and 56 mpg (4.2 L/100 km) using the hybrid power. By charging it daily and driving it normally, we got over 65 mpg (3.62 L/100 km) in a week of mixed driving, which included interstate, suburban, and urban driving—mostly in Conserve mode.

The Aviator starts at $68,900, but the add-ons brought the price just shy of $85,000, although you can still get a ~$6,500 federal tax credit for buying one. There are not a lot of direct comparisons in the luxury space for three-row hybrid SUVs, but a fully equipped Aviator is a few grand north of the Volvo XC90 Recharge. It would be easier to recommend the Aviator at a lower price point, but if you are set on owning a luxury, three-row SUV that gets excellent gas mileage, options are limited.

Building trust and security?

We’re laser focused on building trust and security into the crypto community so that the open financial system we all want is a reality. We recognize that issues like this can hurt that trust. — Coinbase (@coinbase) August 28, 2021

Although Coinbase tweeted that it's ""laser focused on building trust and security into the crypto community,"" panic among its affected customer base is understandable. In addition to a general history of hacked crypto exchanges—including Bitfloor, Mt. Gox, Bitfinex, CoinCheck, QuadrigaCX (technically not a hack), and KuCoin—Coinbase itself has a bad reputation for its response to customers who have been hacked individually.

Most large financial institutions carry cyber fraud insurance policies and will cover hacked checking or savings accounts. ""If you are victimized through cybertheft by no fault of your own, most large banks will make you whole,"" Bankrate.com CFA Greg McBride told USA Today.

The same is not true of Coinbase, which recently told one hacked customer that ""there is no credible or supportable evidence that the compromise of your login credentials was the fault of Coinbase. As a result, Coinbase is unable to reimburse you for your alleged losses.""

In addition to a strict ""your hack is your problem"" policy, Coinbase has been repeatedly accused of extremely slow response to serious customer problems.

This makes the creature an attractive object of study for scientists eager to learn more about the relevant biomechanics. Among other uses, it could lead to small robots capable of equally fast, powerful movements. Now, a team of Harvard University researchers has come up with a new biomechanical model for the mantis shrimp's mighty appendage, and it built a tiny robot to mimic that movement, according to a recent paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).

“We are fascinated by so many remarkable behaviors we see in nature, in particular when these behaviors meet or exceed what can be achieved by human-made devices,” said senior author Robert Wood, a roboticist at Harvard University's John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS). “The speed and force of mantis shrimp strikes, for example, are a consequence of a complex underlying mechanism. By constructing a robotic model of a mantis shrimp striking appendage, we are able to study these mechanisms in unprecedented detail.”

Wood's research group made headlines several years ago when it constructed RoboBee, a tiny robot capable of partially untethered flight. The ultimate goal of that initiative is to build a swarm of tiny interconnected robots capable of sustained untethered flight—a significant technological challenge, given the insect-sized scale, which changes the various forces at play. In 2019, Wood's group announced its achievement of the lightest insect-scale robot so far to have achieved sustained, untethered flight—an improved version called the RoboBee X-Wing. (Kenny Breuer, writing in Nature, described it as ""a tour de force of system design and engineering."")

Now, Wood's group has turned its attention to the biomechanics of the mantis shrimp's knock-out punch. As we've reported previously, mantis shrimp come in many different varieties; there are some 450 known species. But they can generally be grouped into two types: those that stab their prey with spear-like appendages (""spearers"") and those that smash their prey (""smashers"") with large, rounded, and hammer-like claws (""raptorial appendages""). Those strikes are so fast (as much as 23 meters per second, or 51 mph) and powerful, they often produce cavitation bubbles in the water, creating a shock wave that can serve as a follow-up strike, stunning and sometimes killing the prey. Sometimes a strike can even produce sonoluminescence, whereby the cavitation bubbles produce a brief flash of light as they collapse.

According to a 2018 study, the secret to that powerful punch seems to arise not from bulky muscles but from the spring-loaded anatomical structure of the shrimp's arms, akin to a bow and arrow or a mousetrap. The shrimp's muscles pull on a saddle-shaped structure in the arm, causing it to bend and store potential energy, which is released with the swinging of the club-like claw. It's essentially a latch-like mechanism (technically, Latch-mediated spring actuation, or LaMSA), with small structures in the muscle tendons called sclerites serving as the latch.

That much is well understood, and there are several other small organisms capable of producing ultra-fast moves through a similar latching mechanism: frogs' legs and chameleons' tongues, for instance, as well as the mandibles of trap jaw ants and exploding plant seeds. But biologists who have been studying these mechanisms for years have noticed something unusual in the mantis shrimp—a one-millisecond delay between when the unlatching and the snapping action occurs.

“When you look at the striking process on an ultra-high-speed camera, there is a time delay between when the sclerites release and the appendage fires,” said co-first author Nak-seung (Patrick) Hyun, a postdoctoral fellow at SEAS. “It is as if a mouse triggered a mousetrap but instead of it snapping right away, there was a noticeable delay before it snapped. There is obviously another mechanism holding the appendage in place, but no one has been able to analytically understand how the other mechanism works.”

Mantis shrimp lack special muscles to produce such fast accelerations, so biologists have suggested that the sclerites are only responsible for the initial unlatching, while the geometry of arm structure serves as a secondary latch that controls the movement of the arm. ""The idea is that the linkage design itself is such that you're able to actually store energy and release it with just one input motion,"" co-first author Emma Steinhardt told Ars. ""It's this geometric latch that is releasing all the stored energy."" Steinhardt, Hyun, and their fellow co-authors set out to experimentally test this hypothesis.

For their robot version of the mantis shrimp appendage, they relied on the unique manufacturing process inspired by pop-up books (pop-up book MEMS) that Wood's group used to build RoboBee. It involves cutting designs from flat sheets, layering them and bonding the layers with glue, and then folding them into the desired shapes. A miniaturized kind of ""artificial muscle"" can be made with piezoelectric actuators, while thin plastic hinges make excellent joints for rotational motion. Then they conducted numerous experiments in both air and water with two different loading conditions.

They were able to identify four distinct striking phases and confirmed that, indeed, it's the geometry of the mechanism that produces the rapid acceleration after the initial unlatching by the sclerites. The little robot mechanism's performance wasn't quite mantis shrimp-level, but the appendage still reached 26 meters per second in air, the equivalent of a car going from 0 to 58 mph in just four milliseconds. While that's not quite as good as the actual animal, it's still impressive.

The medium might matter: a study last year found that the mantis shrimp punches at half the speed in air, suggesting that the mantis shrimp can precisely control its striking behavior, depending on the surrounding medium. According to Hyun, their experiments showed a so-called ""added mass effect"" in the water-based experiments. ""In fluid mechanics, when you move really quickly, you're actually pushing a heavier mass,"" he told Ars. That effect was low in the RoboBee experiments, since it functions in air, but it's a critical variable when modeling the mantis shrimp strike in water.

The short delay between unlatching and the snap ""is likely a crucial feature enabling repeated and extreme use without the wear and tear of contact latching mechanisms,"" the authors wrote. Going forward, they hope to extend their strategy of combining physical and analytical modeling to learn more about other species, such as the underlying mechanisms of trap jaw ants or leaping frogs.

“This study exemplifies how interdisciplinary collaborations can yield discoveries for multiple fields,” said co-author Sheila Patek, a biologist at Duke University. “The process of building a physical model and developing the mathematical model led us to revisit our understanding of mantis shrimp strike mechanics and, more broadly, to discover how organisms and synthetic systems can use geometry to control extreme energy flow during ultra-fast, repeated-use, movements.”

“Indeed, major medical groups advising against using it because people have died from it.” The judge’s order was asking hospital doctors to do something “unethical and illegal,” he said.
“The doctors who are caring for the guy in the hospital are his doctors, not this guy,” Caplan added, referring to Dr. Wagshul.","A county judge in Ohio has ordered a hospital in Cincinnati to administer ivermectin to an intensive care patient, a move raises questions about the role of the courts in the medical system.

“It is absurd that this order was issued,” Arthur Caplan, professor of bioethics at New York University’s Langone Medical Center, told Ars. “If I were these doctors, I simply wouldn’t do it.”

The order was spurred by a lawsuit filed by Julie Smith, whose 51-year-old husband, Jeffrey, is being treated in West Chester Hospital for COVID-19. The lawsuit was first reported by the Ohio Capital Journal. Jeffrey has been in the hospital since July 15, and as his condition declined, his wife Julie began investigating alternative treatments.

A treatment without supporting evidence

During her husband’s time in the hospital, Julie found groups espousing the purported benefits of ivermectin, which she asked the hospital’s doctors to administer. They refused.

Ivermectin was initially developed as a treatment for river blindness and other parasitic infections. In the US, the FDA has approved it for two specific forms of parasitic infection as well as topical treatments for head lice. Importantly, the doses at which it's administered for internal use in humans are far lower than what’s available over-the-counter for treating parasitic infections in livestock. At high doses, ivermectin can cause serious side effects in humans, ranging from nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea to low blood pressure, seizures, coma, and death.

But people have clung to the idea that ivermectin can treat COVID after a study early in the pandemic suggested that it disrupted SARS-CoV-2’s ability to infect cells. What’s often overlooked is that study was limited to cells in Petri dishes. What’s more, when the NIH looked into it, the agency found that to achieve the ivermectin’s reported disruptive effects, the dose would have to be 100-times greater than what’s currently approved in humans. At those levels, the side-effects would likely be serious. The FDA has pleaded with people not to take ivermectin for COVID.

Still, that hasn’t stopped people on the Internet from encouraging its use. Prescriptions of the drug have spiked, and some people have resorted to buying livestock-grade ivermectin when they can’t obtain a script. Poison control centers have been inundated with calls, yet some doctors continue to push the drug for COVID despite potentially grave side effects and a lack of evidence.

Outside doctor

After watching her husband suffer in the hospital for more than a month, Julie Smith was desperate. He had been in the ICU since the day he was admitted, and he had to be intubated on August 1, according to the lawsuit. Two days later, his sedation wore off and he woke up, ripping the tube out of his throat and “disturbing and/or breaking the feeding tube, which caused food particles and toxins to escape into his lungs; this caused him to aspirate,” the lawsuit says. He developed an infection, which he is still fighting.

Distressed, his wife began investigating “other forms of treatment for COVID-19” and requested that the hospital doctors “administer Ivermectin pursuant to its dosage schedule,” the lawsuit says. Julie offered to sign a form releasing the doctors of any liability, but they refused.

It's unclear when Julie contacted Dr. Fred Wagshul, but on August 20, he prescribed ivermectin for Jeffrey. Wagshul is a pulmonologist with a practice near Dayton, Ohio, and he helps run the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance, a group of doctors which encourage treatment of COVID with ivermectin, fluvoxamine, famotidine, and a smorgasbord of other drugs. Some of those drugs may work in limited circumstances, but most of them appear useless against the virus. Currently, Wagshul does not appear to have any privileges at any hospitals.

""Try anything""

Ivermectin “is absolutely not indicated for COVID. There is no standard of care saying you have to use it,” Caplan said. “Indeed, major medical groups advising against using it because people have died from it.” The judge’s order was asking hospital doctors to do something “unethical and illegal,” he said. “The doctors who are caring for the guy in the hospital are his doctors, not this guy,” Caplan added, referring to Dr. Wagshul.

The judge in the case likely feels that, because Jeffrey Smith is dying, that doctors should “try anything,” Caplan said. “Well, that’s false, because you can still kill him faster.”

“The judge is trying to throw a life preserver to a dying man. The problem is what he’s throwing is actually a 50 pound weight that’ll sink him.”"

It's tempting to make this into a story of gross irresponsibility—a teacher was unvaccinated and read to the class while unmasked. But beyond that, it provides a number of warnings about how our public health system remains under stress as we close in on two years since the start of the pandemic. It also reemphasizes how the delta variant ensures that small errors can easily explode into big problems.

One bad apple

The school in question was a small one, with only a bit over 200 students and 24 staff. It is an elementary school, meaning that its student population is also younger than the cutoff for approved vaccine use. The school did a number of things right, though. Class sizes were kept small, and individual classes were kept in separate rooms, with doors and windows kept open and air filtration equipment installed. There was also a standing policy requiring mask use in place.

But not everything was ideal. The CDC notes that two of the 24 staff members were unvaccinated. While the vaccinated can clearly transmit the delta variant, they are likely to be less infectious, and in a worst case they'd be infectious for a shorter period of time.

One of the unvaccinated staff members, a teacher, began experiencing congestion and fatigue on May 19, problems that they ascribed to allergies. (The ""allergies or COVID?"" internal conversation is one I suspect most of us have had within the past year.) The individual went for a test but ran into a systemic problem: It took two days for the results of the test to come back. This problem was then compounded by a couple of poor choices. The teacher put too much stock in their self-diagnosis of allergies and continued going to school. And during that time, while reading to class, the teacher removed their mask.

On May 23, the test results came back and confirmed that the teacher was infected.

At this point, the school district again responded well, shutting classrooms and starting widespread testing. But by this point, at least 12 of the 22 students in the class were infected (the parents of two students declined testing). In the two rows of seats that were closest to the teacher, eight of the nine students who were tested had infections. For the rest of the class, 28 percent of the students were infected.

Beyond the classroom

For reasons that are unclear, the infection had spread to a second classroom—the CDC suggests it was likely through some informal interactions among students outside the classroom at the school. Six cases occurred in that classroom, although at least two of the infected picked it up from a third person at a sleepover some student's parents had hosted. Four other individual cases were identified in other classrooms. It's impossible to tell whether these came from contact at school or through community spread.

The students managed to spread the virus to eight parents and siblings in total. There were also a number of cases in the community diagnosed at the same time. All of these viruses were closely related to the version of the delta strain that the teacher had, so their relationship to the school outbreak is uncertain. Still, the CDC notes that the community has a vaccination rate of over 72 percent, which probably limited the scope of the outbreak.

Fortunately, none of the people infected by this outbreak required hospitalization.

All of this shows how hard it is to get things right given the infectivity of delta and its persistence in most communities in the US. The school had instituted reasonable policies, although they came up short on mandating all staff be vaccinated. And those policies were undercut by a series of problems that, on the surface, aren't entirely unreasonable. Prior to the pandemic, it had become common practice for people to go to work when feeling ill, and confusing COVID-19 and allergies has likely been a widespread experience. We've all probably made an exception to best public health practices on things like mask wearing at one point or another during the last year and a half. And we as a society have decided to accept a two-day turnaround on test results.

All of these easy-to-make errors get magnified when the background of community spread is higher, which is true in large areas of the US right now. In many of those areas, political leaders are even actively interfering with schools' attempts to implement the sort of policies that were in use in Marin County."

The man, Marcus Venerius Secundio, according to his epitaph, had once been enslaved, but by the end of his life he’d obtained enough wealth and status to sponsor four days of theater performances in Pompeii.

Rags to riches in Imperial Rome

Archaeologists rediscovered Marcus Venerius Secundio’s tomb in the ancient cemetery, or necropolis, of Porta Sarno in the eastern part of Pompeii, where tourists aren’t allowed. His tomb was large and imposing, with a colorfully painted facade depicting green plants on a blue background; traces of the paint still cling to the stone even after 2,000 years. It was also sealed so well that its occupant’s remains had partially mummified, preserving some soft tissue and a few tufts of white hair, along with some scraps of fabric.

Because Pompeii is both amazingly well-preserved and extensively studied, archaeologists were able to match the name inscribed over the tomb’s entrance to a name on wax tablets in the house of a banker named Lucius Caecilius Jucundus, across the city from the necropolis. The banker’s tablets recorded Marcus as a “public slave” who worked as a custodian in the Temple of Venus, which once stood at the western end of town (that’s almost certainly where the second part of his name, Venerius, comes from). But at some point he became a libertus, or freedman, and began to build a new life for himself.

Slavery in Rome wasn’t always a permanent state, and many liberti went on to build relatively prosperous lives for themselves. Evidence of their history persists all over Pompeii. And the libertus Marcus evidently did quite well for himself indeed; the epitaph carved into the stone over his tomb boasts that he once sponsored four full days of theatrical performances for the people of Pompeii, given in both Greek and Latin.

That seems like an odd thing to brag about on your tombstone, but for affluent Romans, sponsoring public entertainment like plays or gladiatorial matches provided a way of showing off while also cementing one’s popularity and fame. It was philanthropy as both advertisement and power move, a la Carnegie and Rockefeller. By bragging about the plays he’d sponsored, Marcus was asserting that he’d been a mover and shaker in his day.

“Greek and Latin ludi for the duration of four days”

In recording his proudest accomplishment, Marcus also offered a glimpse of the broader cultural life of Pompeii. Greek was the most common language in the eastern Mediterranean in the early centuries CE, and plays and other performances were a huge part of the social scene in cities like Pompeii. But archaeologists haven’t found any other evidence that plays were performed in Greek in this cosmopolitan but solidly Roman city.

“That performances in Greek were organized is evidence of the lively and open cultural climate which characterized ancient Pompeii,” said archaeologist Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Pompeii Archaeological Park.

Plenty of other archaeological and historical evidence paints the buried city as a diverse place, full of people and cultures from around the Roman world. Zuchtriegel described evidence of Greek theater in town as “another tessera of a large mosaic” that was Pompeii’s cultural life.

Marcus’ rise from slavery to wealth would have been remarkable but not entirely unheard of for an ancient Roman, especially in a bustling, socially mobile city like Pompeii. What’s especially odd about him is that, when he died sometime around the age of 60, he was buried. Typically, adults in Imperial Rome would have been cremated and then entombed in a funeral urn, like the lovely blue glass one that shares space in Marcus’ tomb. It’s inscribed with “Novia Amabilis,” or “Kind Wife,” so it’s not terribly hard to guess who’s inside. Burial was usually for children.

Archaeologists still aren’t sure why Marcus, who seems so quintessentially Roman in so many ways, didn’t follow the conventional route of cremation. That’s going to take further analysis of his remains, other evidence in the tomb, and maybe even corroborating evidence from other sources like the banker’s wax tablets. And it’s a question archaeologists may never be able to definitively answer.

But archaeologist Llorene Alpont of the University of Valencia suggests that the incredible preservation of Marcus’ partially mummified remains could offer a clue.

“We still need to understand whether the partial mummification of the deceased is due to intentional treatment or not,” she said. Identifying the preserved scraps of fabric found along with the remains could help; Alpont added, “From the sources, we know that certain textiles such as asbestos were used in embalming.”

Off the map for now

For the moment, tourists can’t visit Marcus’ tomb, or the rest of the Porta Sarno necropolis, but the Pompeii Archaeological Park is currently studying the feasibility of opening the area to the public. Several of the tombs in the necropolis need to be stabilized before that can happen, and a few of them may even get some restoration work. If those plans eventually come to fruition, then Marcus Venerius Secundio’s name may once again be associated with a public spectacle in Pompeii."

It is not a hard-and-fast rule, but most cars would be better with the addition of some electric motors. There are always exceptions—heavy batteries and an electric motor would ruin a Caterham 7, for instance—but it holds true for most cars. Consider the Jeep Wrangler 4xe, the new plug-in hybrid variant of the nation's favorite rock-crawler.

For non-car people, Wrangler might as well be synonymous with Jeep. The current-generation Wrangler only dates back to 2017, but it still carries plenty of styling cues that hark straight back to the original World War II Jeep. Big wheels project out from the body, protected in plastic arch extensions that house the LED daylight running lights up front.

But it's not a particularly big SUV by the standards of 2021, at 188.4 inches (4,786 mm) long (including the rear-mounted spare tire). The doors signal to you that they're removable by way of large external hinges. The only real clues that this is a plug-in hybrid are some electric blue bits here and there (like the tow hooks) plus the charging port that lives just below the A pillar on the driver's side.

To enter, pull on that rugged door handle, then hop up into the cabin via the running board and a grab handle mounted right on the A pillar. The 1940s design cues continue on the inside, with the most vertical dashboard I've encountered in many years. That does mean the UConnect touchscreen is within easy reach, at least. Advertisement

Under the distinctive hood you'll find a 2.0 L turbocharged four-cylinder direct-injection gasoline engine that generates 270 hp (200 kW) and 295 lb-ft (400 Nm). There's also a 134 hp (100 kW), 181 lb-ft (245 Nm) electric traction motor mounted to the front of the eight-speed automatic transmission—in this case the ever-excellent ZF 8HP.

There's also a two-speed transfer case with both 4-high and 4-low four-wheel drive modes as well as two-wheel drive for on-road activities. Our test Wrangler 4xe was the Sahara model, which features open Dana 44 front and rear differentials, although a limited-slip rear is available as an option. More hardcore off-roaders will want the Rubicon, which upgrades the diffs with Tru-Lok lockers.

In total, the hybrid powertrain is rated at 375 hp (280 kW) and 470 lb-ft (637 Nm), which makes this the most powerful Wrangler on sale after the one with a V8 hemi. (It has an identical torque output, which is probably more important in day-to-day driving as well as off-roading.) The engine and motor are connected by a clutch that can disconnect the internal combustion engine when the Wrangler 4xe is in electric mode.

The lithium-ion traction battery is located underneath the rear seat. Total capacity is 17.3 kWh, and about 15 kWh of that is usable by the driver. It can charge at up to 7.2 kW when connected to a level 2 (240 V, AC) charger, which will take just under three hours to bring the battery pack back to 100 percent.

In electric mode, a fully charged battery is good for 22 miles of electric-only range, according to Jeep and the Environmental Protection Agency. You select the drive mode via a button on the dash, and there's another button to engage maximum regenerative braking in this mode, which in effect enables one-pedal driving.

The other drive modes are hybrid, which is the default mode and which blends the electric motor and gasoline engine; and e-save, which tells the Wrangler 4xe to just use the internal combustion engine, saving the battery for later. As long as you've got charge in the battery, hybrid mode should return 49 mpg (4.8 l/100 km). But when the battery is empty, efficiency plummets to a combined 20 mpg (11.8 L/100km).

Honestly, not great to drive on the road

On the road, the Wrangler 4xe encourages a relaxed driving style that should help you get close to the EPA numbers. I won't mince words: the Wrangler has the worst road manners of any new vehicle I've driven in a while, though. Between the knobbly off-road tires and the solid front and rear axles, the Jeep follows every camber and bump in the road, wiggling this way and that with little yaw movements as you ostensibly drive in a straight line. It will cruise at highway speeds, but it's not a particularly fun experience.

Around town, with some charge in the battery and speeds under 25 mph (40 km/h), it works fine as a runabout—that hunting and moving around excepted. It doesn't feel entirely Greatest Generation, however. The Wrangler 4xe's damping over potholes and the like was extremely good, quelling sharp rebound movements effectively.

That suggests the Wrangler 4xe would be highly competent off-road, something we weren't able to test. Not getting to that is a shame really, because that's the main reason this Jeep exists, and I'm pretty sure that electric off-roading in near silence is even better than normal off-roading accompanied by engine noises. (Jeep has even built out some trailhead charging stations at Moab, Utah, as well as the Big Bear and the Rubicon Trail in California.)

Regardless of which trim you pick, in our opinion the Wrangler 4xe is the definite pick of the range, if for no other reason than at least some of your driving can be emissions-free. With an MSRP that starts at $51,025, it's definitely not the cheapest Wrangler in the lineup, although it does qualify for the full $7,500 IRS plug-in vehicle tax credit. That hasn't stopped Jeep from shifting a lot of Wrangler 4xes, in part thanks to some aggressive lease deals.

For on-road driving, you'll find the Ford Bronco or Land Rover Defender far more civilized, and both should be equally as capable on the trail. But we're still waiting for the plug-in Defender to come to the US and for Ford to announce an electrified version of the Bronco. As such, I'm prepared to forgive the Wrangler's idiosyncratic handling for now. But you probably shouldn't buy one if you don't plan to get it muddy.

Before Samsung showed up and took over the Wear OS ecosystem, the top Android smartwatch manufacturer was Fossil. Even after Samsung's arrival, Fossil is still going, and today the company announced the Fossil Gen 6 watches.

The Gen 6 Fossil watches are the company's first to ship with Qualcomm's Snapdragon Wear 4100+, a 12 nm, Cortex A53-based ARM chip. The ""plus"" at the end of that 4100 model number means there's a low-power co-process on the SoC now, which can handle things like health tracking without waking up the big cores. It looks like the new SoC is the only upgrade over the gen 5 watches. There's still a 1.28-inch OLED display, 1GB of RAM, and 8GB of storage. Fossil doesn't say how big the battery is, but it charges to 80 percent in 30 minutes. The watch has GPS, NFC, Wi-Fi, a PPG heart rate sensor, and is water-resistant.

Fossil's new watches range from $299 to $319, and compared to the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4's $250-$350 price, Fossil's new watches don't make a ton of sense in a post-Samsung Wear OS world.

Samsung and Google teamed up to revamp the Wear OS ecosystem with all-new hardware and software, and the two tech giants seem to be squeezing out smaller fashion brands like Fossil. The Galaxy Watch 4 ships with a brand-new version of Wear OS, version 3, while Fossil is still using Wear OS 2. It's apparently going to be a while before Fossil catches up to Samsung. The company's press release says it will be upgraded to Wear OS 3 but links to a Google forum post that says, ""We expect our partners to be able to roll out [Wear OS 3] starting in mid to second half of 2022."" That's something like 10 to 16 months from now.

Wear OS 3 combines the best of Google's Wear OS and (supposedly) the best of Samsung's Tizen OS. If you're in Google's ecosystem, Wear OS 3 comes with a recommitment from Google in terms of app support, and there is already a new version of Google Maps and exclusive access to YouTube Music in Wear OS 3. (If you're not in Google's ecosystem, you should probably just buy an Apple Watch.)

There's also the hardware issue. Qualcomm has not been a great partner for Wear OS and isn't putting a ton of effort into its wearable SoCs. The Wear 4100 was the company's first big speed upgrade in six years, and even then it was a lackluster chip. The Galaxy Watch 4 tries much harder to be a competitive smartwatch, with a 5 nm, dual-core A55 SoC that you could justifiably call ""state of the art"" for a wearable.

As nice as it was to have Fossil occupy the power vacuum in the Wear OS ecosystem for the last few years, now that Samsung has shown up, Fossil is shipping a more expensive, slower smartwatch with old software that won't be updated for 10 months. It's not really clear what's going on with Wear OS when it comes to smaller companies like Fossil. Is this just a temporary hiccup while the revamp transition happens, or is Google OK with having a de facto one-OEM ecosystem like this? Google certainly seems to have made a lot of concessions to Samsung when it comes to the Wear OS software."

Microsoft fixed the vulnerability on the server-side and said they've seen no evidence of data being accessed by unauthorized parties, but the researchers who found the flaw and the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) recommend that all Cosmos DB users who had the Jupyter Notebook feature enabled rotate their keys.

Jupyter Notebook privilege escalation

The flaw was located in Jupyter Notebook, a Microsoft Azure tool for data exploration, data cleaning, data transformations, numerical simulations, statistical modeling, data visualization and machine learning. The tool integrates with Cosmos DB, a NoSQL-type database service used to store data for Azure-hosted applications by thousands of organizations, including many Fortune 500 companies.

""A series of misconfigurations in the notebook feature opened up a new attack vector we were able to exploit,"" researchers from cloud security company Wiz said in a report. ""In short, the notebook container allowed for a privilege escalation into other customer notebooks. As a result, an attacker could gain access to customers’ Cosmos DB primary keys and other highly sensitive secrets such as the notebook blob storage access token. ""

The primary keys provide administrator level access to Cosmos DB instances with full read/write/delete permissions. The database service also requires users to have secondary keys as well to make the key rotation process easier. The secondary keys were not impacted.

Since it found no evidence that this flaw has been exploited before the researchers found and reported the vulnerability on August 12, Microsoft only notified the Cosmos DB users who could potentially be affected due to the researchers' activity. The researchers estimate that only around 30% of users potentially had their primary long-term keys exposed to this issue. That's because Jupyter Notebook has been enabled by default for every new Cosmos DB account created since late January 2021 and could be manually enabled by older accounts, too. Meanwhile, the research activity only lasted for around one week before the flaw was reported.

""Starting this February, every newly created Cosmos DB account had the notebook feature enabled by default and their primary key could have been exposed even if the customer was not aware of it and never used the feature,"" the researchers said. ""If the customer didn’t use the feature in the first three days, it was automatically disabled. An attacker who exploited the vulnerability during that window could obtain the primary key and have ongoing access to the Cosmos DB account.""

Mitigating the Cosmos DB vulnerability

In addition to replacing their primary read-write keys, Cosmos DB users should also review and restrict the network exposure of their databases. If databases are accessible directly from the internet, they are obviously at higher risk, but even those that are not could have been exposed to this vulnerability.

The Wiz researchers point out that it's common for Azure firewall configurations to have an exception enabled called “Accept connections from within public Azure datacenters.” This is required for some Azure services to function, but it also means that any other tenant within the Azure network has network access to the database, too, and it's not hard for an attacker to get an Azure account and attack databases from within the Azure IP space.

One way to restrict access is to define specific IP addresses that are allowed to connect to the database. Another is to configure access to Cosmos DB via a virtual network , and a third option is to configure an Azure Private Link for private endpoint connections.

Regenerating primary keys requires replacing the primary key in all applications with the secondary key and then regenerating the primary keys as described in this Microsoft guide. However, before that process is started, organizations should have an inventory of their Cosmos DBs with Jupyter Notebook enabled.

An easy way of doing that is to perform a nslookup for [cosmosdb-name].notebook.cosmos.azure.com where [cosmosdb-name] is the name of every Cosmos DB account they have. If the Jupyter feature is enabled, that subdomain should exist and nslookup should return information about it. If nslookup responds with domain not found, it means that Jupyter is not enabled for that account.

Since key regeneration can be a lengthy process that depends on how quickly the configuration of applications can be updated, security teams might want to monitor if and when the keys have been regenerated for every Cosmos DB account. Wiz created a short PowerShell script that can achieve that by analyzing the logs.

Another long-term mitigation to consider is migrating from primary and secondary access keys to role-based access control (RBAC). This allows a more fine-grained access control per user and security principal to Cosmos DB and the identities can be audited in the Azure Cosmos DB diagnostic logs. Enabling diagnostic logging has also help discover access from suspicious or unauthorized IP addresses."

While some hoped this might have a significant impact on the ability of ransomware groups to organize themselves, the bans only pushed their activity further underground, making it harder for security researchers and companies to monitor it.

If anything, the attacks in the months that followed the forum bans then have been more potent and audacious than ever. The truth is that ransomware is the life blood of the cybercrime economy and it will take extraordinary measures to put an end to it. The groups coordinating the attacks are highly professionalized and in many ways resemble modern corporate structures with development teams, sales and PR departments, external contractors and service providers that all get a cut from the illegal proceeds. They even use business lingo in their communications with victims, referring to them as clients who buy their data decryption services.

""The way I describe it is: You have the business world that we all know. The criminals have a parallel one that's like the Upside Down from Stranger Things. It's the exact same world, only darker and twisted,"" Steve Ragan, security researcher at Akamai, tells CSO.

An underground economy relying on ransomware

By looking at what's involved in ransomware operations and how the groups are organized, it's easy to see that ransomware is at the center of the cybercrime economy. Ransomware groups employ people who:

Write file-encryption programs (the development team)

Set up and maintain the payment and leak sites, and the communication channels (the IT infrastructure team)

Advertise the ransomware service on forums (the sales team)

Communicate with journalists and post messages on Twitter and announcements on their blogs (the PR and social media team)

Negotiate the ransom payments (the customer support team)

Perform the manual hacking and lateral movement on victims' networks to deploy the ransomware program for a part of the profit (external contractors known as affiliates or penetration testers)

The affiliates often buy access into networks from other cybercriminals who already compromised systems with Trojan programs or botnets or through stolen credentials. These third parties are known as network access brokers. Affiliates might also buy data dumps that contain stolen account information or internal information that could help with target reconnaissance. Spam email services and bulletproof hosting are also often used by ransomware gangs.

In other words, a lot of parties are in the cybercrime ecosystem that directly or indirectly earn money thanks to ransomware. So, it's not unusual for these groups to become more professional and operate similar to companies with investors, managers, product marketing, customer support, job offerings, partnerships and so on. It's a trend that has been slowly building up over the years.

""The cybercrime underground has become essentially an economy unto itself where you have service providers, product creators, financiers, infrastructure providers,"" Brandon Hoffman, CISO of security firm Intel 471, tells CSO. ""It's an economy just like ours where you have all these suppliers and buyers of different things. Just like in our free market economy, as you have all these different types of service providers and product providers available it's natural for them to start to come together and build a business together to offer a package of services and goods, just like we do here in the standard economy. So, I 100% agree that it is going that way. It's just really hard for us to prove it.""

""We've known for years that criminals have a software development lifecycle just like the rest of us,"" Ragan says. ""They have marketing, PR, middle management. They have people responsible for lower-level criminals who report to bigger-level criminals. It's not new. It's just that more people are starting to hear it and are paying attention to the parallels.""

Ransomware groups adapt to market pressures

Ransomware attacks have crippled many hospitals, schools, public services, local and state government institutions and even police departments over the years, but the attack in early May on Colonial Pipeline, the largest pipeline system for refined oil products in the US, was a milestone.

The breach, attributed to a Russia-based ransomware group called DarkSide, forced the company to shut down its entire gasoline pipeline system for the first time in its 57-year history to prevent the ransomware from spreading to critical control systems. This resulted in fuel shortages across the US East Coast. The incident received widespread attention in the media and in Washington as it highlighted the threat that ransomware poses to critical infrastructure, spurring debates on whether such attacks should be classified as a form of terrorism.

Even the operators of DarkSide understood the seriousness of the situation and announced the introduction of ""moderation"" for its affiliates—the third-party contractors that actually do the hacking and deployment of the ransomware—claiming they want ""to avoid social consequences in the future."" But the heat was already too much for the group's service providers.

Only days after the attack, the administrator of XSS, one of the largest Russian-language cybercrime forums, announced the banning of all ransomware-related activities on the platform citing “too much PR” and heightening of law enforcement risks to “hazardous level,” according to a translation by cybercrime intelligence firm Flashpoint.

Other high-profile ransomware groups including REvil, immediately announced similar moderation policies for its affiliates prohibiting attacks on healthcare, educational and government institutions, in an attempt to control the PR damage. That too wasn't enough. Two other big cybercrime forums, Exploit and Raid, soon followed with bans on ransomware activities.

In the aftermath, DarkSide announced that it was going to shut down its operations after also losing access to its blog, payment server, Bitcoin wallet and other public infrastructure it had, claiming its hosting provider responded only with ""at the request of law enforcement agencies."" One month later, the FBI would announce that it managed to recover the $4.4 million in cryptocurrency that Colonial Pipeline was forced to pay the hackers to decrypt its systems and resume normal operations.

The banning of ransomware activities on the most popular cybercrime forums was a significant development because for many years these forums served as the primary place where ransomware groups recruited affiliates. These forums offer an easy means of public and private communication between cybercriminals and even provide money escrow services for transactions where parties don't know and trust each other.

The bans also affected, to some extent, the cybersecurity firms who monitor these forums to collect intelligence on threat actors and new threats. While most cybercrime researchers knew the forum bans would not stop ransomware operations overall, some did wonder what their next move would be. Would they migrate to less popular forums? Would they set up their own websites for advertising and communicating with affiliates? Would they move to real time chat programs like Jabber or Telegram?

""What that did was move those discussions to other private groups,"" Ragan says. ""They're not going away. What they did was go out of the public spotlight. For the longest time, you could see their recruiting, their development, their discussions, what sort of features they were working on. Now that's gone.... You're not going to be able to predict a lot of changes. Unfortunately, that means you won't know about new variants or a new function that got added until the first victim gets hit.""

According to Ondrej Krehel, the founder and CEO of incident response and digital forensics firm LIFARS, ransomware operations were not impacted by the forum bans because most of the actors involved in such activities were already communicating via private groups on Telegram and Threema that had existed for two or three years.

There was still some traction on the forums, as part of the marketing efforts, but if you really wanted to get something more concrete, you would have to be part of these groups already and some require paying a fraction of a Bitcoin with a wallet that has been associated with known criminal activities to prove yourself, Krehel tells CSO. ""This rate of growth [of ransomware] will continue,"" he says.

Cybercriminals quitting, or just evolving to different roles?

Every few months a high-profile ransomware group announces that it's shutting down its operations. Last month it was Avaddon. Before that it was DarkSide. Before that it was Maze, and so on. Sometimes, when they decide to disband, these groups release their master keys which might help some victims who have not already paid a ransom or recovered their files from backups, but the criminals behind the groups don't really disappear from the ecosystem or go to jail. They just move to other groups or change roles, for example from a manager of a successful ransomware operation to an investor.

Ragan compares this to traditional criminals using shell companies to funnel money and then, when the heat gets too high, disbanding them and moving on. ""It's almost exactly like that,"" he says. ""Again, that's another parallel between the criminal world and what we see on our side of the little wall. They're both criminal acts, but at the same time, organizations that aren't thinking of cyber, they're used to the concept of shell companies and how they can be used for nefarious means. Well, these brands that the ransomware and the malware groups use—same difference.""

According to Krehel, the lifespan of ransomware groups is usually around two years because they understand that after that time they'll receive too much attention, especially if they've been very successful, and the best thing to do is to retire the group and create a new one. Maybe some members retire and become venture capitalists in other groups, but this shuffling of groups is more about generating confusion and making it harder for law enforcement to get all of the participants' names, he says.

The ROI from ransomware is so good that career cybercriminals can't afford not being involved in it. That's why groups that have been associated with other forms of cybercrime, such as credit card theft or hacking into banks, have started either adopting ransomware as a revenue stream or collaborating with ransomware gangs.

""The groups have shifted and joined up with other groups and made alliances,"" Ragan says. ""Literally, if you were to parallel that similar to the real world it's mergers and acquisitions. They might think they obtained talent from other groups who joined them and now they're developing their own ransomware, or they get their affiliate programs and merge it into one.""

""It's quite clear that some of these 'new strains' are likely stemming from 'old' groups,"" says Hoffman. ""Maze, Egregor, REvil, all these guys, they splinter off and they create other things like AstraLocker and LV and all these new ones that are coming out. They're not all related but there's a lot of association between new groups and old groups.""

Some of the new groups might also serve the purpose of recruiting new people into the business and giving them a platform where they can gain experience. When the group has served its goal and lived its life, some of its affiliates will move on to more established groups.

""There is an ecosystem for criminals for hire, who do have a good criminal record, who conducted good offensive missions and they didn't get arrested,"" Krehel says. ""Those people are now more expensive and their expertise has been added to their criminal CV and are trusted by criminal rings. It also seems to be the case that members are often changing groups. It's almost like you look at Google and Facebook, or some large companies where people are switching jobs. So, there's this constant job switch.""

Offensive actions might be needed

Cybercriminals are not going to give up on ransomware easily because it's too profitable and many of them live in Russia or former Soviet Union countries where the likelihood of getting arrested for extorting money from Western organizations is low. Malware programs that originate in Russia or the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) often have had built-in checks that prevent their deployment on computers that use Russian or other languages from CIS countries. It's an unwritten rule that malware creators and cybercriminals know: Don't target local companies and you'll be fine. Russia doesn't extradite its citizens and given the current geopolitical climate between the country and the West, increased collaboration at the law enforcement level on cybercrime is not very likely."

A security engineer is a cybersecurity professional who helps develop and implement strategies and systems to protect their organization's infrastructure from cyberattacks. This is a role in an organization for someone with enough knowledge and experience to understand both the systems they're defending and the attacks they'll face, and they usually spend more time creating secure systems and networks than they do reacting to threats.

As companies large and small finally realize that cybersecurity is everybody's problem, security engineers are increasingly in demand, and command salaries to match. While this isn't a job for beginners, if you have the right background and experience, it could make for an exciting job and a solid step up in your career as a security pro.

Here, we answer some frequently asked questions about this critical security role.

What does a security engineer do?

A security engineer designs, builds, and defends scalable, secure, and robust systems for their organization's IT environment, protecting all organization assets, including those located away from headquarters. They'll analyze networks to make sure they are operating securely,and try to anticipate possible cybersecurity issues that might arise. Common responsibilities of security engineers include:

Helping to create security standards and practices for their organization

Recommending security improvements to management

Testing, deploying, and maintaining tools such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and data encryption

Conducting scans of networks and penetration tests to look for vulnerabilities

Monitoring networks for breaches or intrusions

Leading incident response activities and investigations into how intrusions occurred

Helping plan cybersecurity strategy

What is the difference between a security analyst and a security engineer?

Understanding the distinction between a security engineer and a security analyst is a good way to grasp the nature of a security engineer job. A security analyst, particularly if they work in a security operations center, spends much of their time tracking down threats moment by moment or reacting to breaches in progress. A security engineer, by contrast, has the more strategic role of building out both technical infrastructure and a set of organizational policies that harden the entire company against attacks.

Day to day, this means a security engineer spends less time chasing down attackers and more time designing systems so that security is built in, as well as penetration testing existing systems to test their infrastructure's mettle and working with other staff to improve security awareness. However, it's always important to keep in mind that job descriptions vary from company to company, and in smaller organizations in particular a security engineer might find themselves wearing an analyst hat as well.

Sometimes you'll see the security engineer job described specifically as a cybersecurity engineer; cybersecurity is a term used to distinguish the protection of tech infrastructure from the physical security needed to protect buildings and people, but a security engineer is almost always concerned with cybersecurity. At larger organizations with many security engineers on staff, you may see a distinction between a network security engineer and an application security engineer; these are two specializations within the security engineer job, focusing on securing network infrastructure and application code, respectively.

How to become a security engineer? The education and certifications you need

You'll probably begin your journey to become a security engineer in college. For the most part, people aiming for a security engineer job will have a bachelor's degree in a relevant subject, such as engineering, computer engineering, or computer science. Some schools even offer undergraduate cybersecurity degrees.

IT has traditionally been a field that values skills over paper credentials—we all know the stories of tech pioneers who dropped out of high school—but that's changed over the years as the industry has become more professionalized. That said, most hiring managers do value experience and demonstrated skills, and if you can put together that sort of resume, that can help make up for a non-technical undergraduate degree. At any rate, nobody would make an immediate leap from college to a security engineer gig; you would need to pass through an introductory phase of your career first, possibly as a security analyst.

One way to signal to your employer or potential future employers that you're ready to advance to a security engineer job is by pursuing some relevant formal certifications. Because security engineers have a fairly wide range of duties under their remit, there are a number of industry certs that fit the bill. The following are some of the most widely recommended:

What particular skills does a security engineer need?

Of course, you can't just rack up the degrees and certifications and expect to waltz into a security engineer job: all those are just proxies for the relevant skills you'll be expected to demonstrate in order to secure a gig.

A good security engineer should have the following big-picture skills:

An expert-level understanding of information security concepts and their application via relevant technology solutions.

The ability to develop, design, test, and deploy security-related systems and subsystems, as well as clean up computer code bases for common coding vulnerabilities, and work with other departments within the organization to secure IT systems.

Penetration testing skills, especially if the organization does not have devoted penetration testers.

Knowledge of network equipment and architecture, and possibly the ability to install, test, and configure an entire network infrastructure.

In addition, anyone coming into a security engineer gig is going to want at least some of these specific tools in their kit:

Expertise in antimalware software, intrusion detection, firewalls, and content filtering

Knowledge of risk assessment tools, technologies, and methods

Expertise in designing secure networks, systems, and application architectures

Disaster recovery and computer forensics technologies and methods

Planning, researching, and developing security policies, standards, and procedures

System administration, supporting multiple platforms and applications

Expertise with malicious software

Endpoint security solutions, including file integrity monitoring and data loss prevention

Cloud security, particularly with AWS and Azure

Automating security testing tools

Chef – a configuration management tool

Git – a tool that helps track anomalous changes to files

What interview questions should a security engineer be prepared to answer?

If you're lucky enough to have an interview for a security engineer job lined up, you're probably curious — and maybe a little nervous — about what sort of questions you might encounter. The Infosec Institute has a really great list that shows the breadth of things you'll be asked in these scenarios. They break the questions down into three levels of difficulty, but to us, perhaps the more interesting distinction is all the different ways the questions will make you think. They include:

Questions about basic knowledge (""What is the CIA triangle?"")

Questions to see if you can explain important techniques (""How would you login to Active Directory from a Linux or Mac box?"")

Questions about your own personal cyber-life (""How do you protect your home wireless access point?"")

Questions that give you an opportunity to show off your technical problem-solving skills (""You are remoted in to a headless system in a remote area. You have no physical access to the hardware and you need to perform an OS installation. What do you do?"")

Questions that give you an opportunity to show off your organizational problem-solving skills (""You are an employee for a tech department in a non-management position. A high-level executive demands that you break protocol and allow him to use his home laptop at work. What do you do?"")

Questions about your overall tech philosophy (""What do you think of social networking sites such as Facebook and LinkedIn?"")

Some of these have definite right and wrong answers. But many—and these are the more important ones by far—are a chance for you to show an interviewer how you think, how you approach problems, and what knowledge you draw from in the process.

What jobs are available for security engineers?

You should at this point have a pretty good idea of what a security engineer job entails. One thing to keep in mind is that, while this is a tech job, it's not a job that's limited to the tech industry: just about every company that's larger than a handful of people, in every sector, needs security engineers. Government agencies and financial institutions in particular have a great need for security engineers, but you could also find yourself working in manufacturing or retail as well.

One thing's for certain: the demand for security engineers is growing, with no sign of letting up. In 2021, Focal Point listed it as the most in-demand cybersecurity job for the sixth year in a row, and demand was expected to grow another 12% through 2026.

What is the average security engineer salary?

And as you'd expect for an in-demand job that requires specialized skills and some industry experience, salaries for security engineers are generous. As of this writing, Glassdoor's average for the position is $109,770; the Infosec Institute's 2021 stats for the U.S. range from $91,000 in Atlanta to more than $125,000 in San Francisco."

The threat uses what researchers from antivirus vendor Sophos call “intermittent encryption,” meaning it only encrypts chunks of data inside a file instead of its complete contents. This speeds the encryption process, or better said data corruption process, significantly but also tricks ransomware protection systems that rely on statistical analysis to detect potentially unauthorized file encryption.

LockFile built with evasion in mind

LockFile uses multiple techniques designed to evade detection, starting with its own executable file which is both packed and malformed. The first section of the file is full of zeroes and is followed by a second section that contains encoded data. Three functions located at the end decode the data from the second section, place it into the first section, and then jump to that code to execute it. The goal of this routine is to throw off endpoint protection software that monitors file execution.

The malware then leverages the Windows Management Interface (WMI) to scan for and kill important processes associated with business applications including Hyper-V virtual machines, Oracle VM Virtual Box manager, Oracle VM Virtual Box services, Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL database, Oracle MTS Recovery Service, Oracle RDBMS Kernel, Oracle TNS Listener and VMware virtual machines.

The goal of killing these processes is to remove any system locks put on databases, virtual machines, or configuration files put by those applications so that the ransomware can encrypt them. By leveraging the WMI, the processes will appear to be terminated by the system itself, not by the ransomware executable. This is another detection evasion technique that is also designed to complicate incident response.

Another noteworthy trick is the way in which LockFile performs operations on files. The malware doesn't directly modify files on disk, but maps them into the system's RAM memory first, performs the modifications there and then relies on the Windows System process to commit the modifications to disk.

To a behavior monitoring product, this will appear as input/output (I/O) operations performed by the OS itself, not by a potentially suspicious process. It will also happen with a delay that can range from seconds to minutes, depending on how busy the disk is.

LockFile is not the first ransomware threat to use memory mapped I/O. Maze and WastedLocker have also used this technique, but it is not very common, Mark Loman, Sophos's director of engineering for Next-Gen Technologies, said in a blog post.

Intermittent encryption

The use of intermittent encryption, however, is a new development that the Sophos researchers have not seen before in ransomware. Other threats like LockBit 2.0, DarkSide and BlackMatter have used partial encryption, encrypting only the beginning of documents to speed the process, but LockFile's approach is different and significant.

From a security perspective, incomplete encryption is bad because it leaves data exposed, but the goal of ransomware is not data privacy. It is controlled and reversible data corruption that just uses encryption as a tool. Therefore, ransomware doesn't need to encrypt the full contents of files but just enough to make them unusable to the user, which is what LockBit 2.0, DarkSide and BlackMatter achieve by encrypting the starting portion of files.

LockFile's approach, however, is to encrypt every other 16 bytes of a file. So, the resulting files will contain 16 bytes of scrambled data, followed by 16 bytes of untouched original data, followed by another 16 bytes of scrambled data and so on. This process is not as fast as encrypting just the starting portion but has another benefit: It skews statistical analysis.

Some ransomware detection programs use statistical analysis tests to detect if a file modification is the result of file encryption. If the test indicates that a file has been encrypted, the program will block the process from modifying additional files.

This works because encrypted files, which are made up of random data, look very different from an unencrypted file to statistical analysis. One of the tests commonly used to detect statistically significant differences in data is called the chi-squared (chi^2) test.

""An unencrypted text file of 481KB (say, a book) has a chi^2 score of 3850061. If the document was encrypted by DarkSide ransomware, it would have a chi^2 score of 334 – which is a clear indication that the document has been encrypted,"" Loman explained. ""If the same document is encrypted by LockFile ransomware, it would still have a significantly high chi^2 score of 1789811."" In other words, if a detection program is calibrated by its creators to only detect and act on very big statistical differences to avoid false positives, it could miss the encryption performed by LockFile.

The last trick in LockFile's playbook is to delete itself after finishing the encryption process. This can frustrate incident response because responders will search for a ransomware binary to analyze and clean off the system.

LockFile distribution

The LockFile ransomware has been distributed by exploiting a series of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange servers known collectively as ProxyShell (CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523 and CVE-2021-31207). Patches for these vulnerabilities have been available since April and May, but despite being more serious and easier to exploit than the ProxyLogon vulnerability exploited to install web shells on Exchange servers, they have not received the same level of attention. As a result, many organizations have not patched their servers.

The group behind the ransomware is also leveraging an NTLM relay attack known as PetitPotam to gain access to domain controllers inside corporate networks."

In combination with China's newly enacted and still little-understood Data Protection Law, which goes into effect on September 1, 2021, this law promises to impose a host of new data privacy, security, and protective obligations on all US and global companies doing business in China.

These significant laws fit into China's broad ""informatization policy,"" which Chinese President Xi Jinping has described as the modern equivalent of industrialization. However, the data protection law comes closer to serving more as a cybersecurity law than the PIPL. In his efforts to boost China to"" cyber superpower"" status, President Xi has famously said that ""cybersecurity and informatization are two wings of one body, and two wheels of one engine.""

Both national security and the public interest come into play

Modeled in part on the EU's stringent and pace-setting General Data Protection Regulation (GPDR), PIPL creates a legal regime for all data from both the perspectives of national security and the public interest. It aims to achieve four objectives:

Protect the rights and interests of individuals Regulate personal information processing activities Safeguard the lawful and ""orderly flow"" of data Facilitate reasonable use of personal information

Its focus on national security departs from Western privacy frameworks such as the GDPR and California's Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). The PIPL further differs from these two forms of data privacy by containing provisions addressing China's digital sovereignty. These provisions aim to limit the ability of overseas entities to infringe on Chinese citizens' rights and constrain the danger to the country's national security.

Organizations handling Chinese citizens' data must meet conditions

The PIPL states that ""personal information processors,"" namely any organization handling the personal data of Chinese citizens, may handle that information only if the processor meets one of the following conditions:

The processor obtains personal consent The information is necessary for the conclusion and performance of a contract in which the individual is a party or necessary for the implementation of human resource management by following the labor rules and regulations established under the law and the collective contract signed per the law. The information is necessary to perform statutory duties or statutory obligations. The information is necessary to respond to public health emergencies or to protect the life, health, and property safety of natural persons in an emergency. The information is necessary to carry out news reports, public opinion supervision, and other acts for the public interest, and handle personal information within a reasonable range. Processing personal information disclosed by individuals or other legally disclosed personal information within a reasonable scope is conducted by following the provisions of this law. The information is processed under other circumstances stipulated by laws and administrative regulations.

The law emphasizes that users must consent to allow their data to be processed, and users must be fully informed. Individuals are granted the right to withdraw their consent at any time. Moreover, information processors cannot withhold goods or services from individuals who refuse to allow their information to be processed or used.

How organizations can comply with PIPL is still unclear

How organizations doing business in China can comply with the PIPL's complex provisions is unclear because many regulatory proceedings that flesh out how compliance would work have yet to occur. ""This is a very new law and quite complex, so US companies that have operations in China are only just now beginning to focus on this law and are trying to figure out how it will affect their operations,"" Judith Alison Lee, partner at Gibson Dunn and co-chair of the firm's International Trade Practice Group, tells CSO.

Moreover, although PIPL might go into effect in November, the fine print on how the law operates won't emerge until later when various Chinese ministries issue regulations, Rogier Creemers, China Digital Economy Fellow at New America and a postdoctoral scholar in Law and Governance of China at the University of Leiden's Van Vollenhoven Institute, tells CSO. ""Many laws in China, such as the Personal Information Protection Law, work as framework laws,"" Creemers tells CSO.

""For instance, the new law creates a mandate for there to be a security review for the export of personal data. But the Cyberspace Administration of China, the regulator in this specific sector, is empowered to make those rules. So, until those specific rules come out, we don't know what's going to happen.""

Cross-border flow of information and avoiding sanctions are top priorities

However, organizations that deal with any form of personal data in China can start prioritizing the critical aspects of the law ahead of any further regulatory clarity. ""The single most important provisions are going to be those that deal with the cross-border flow of personal information. Those are going to be crucial,"" Creemers says.

""My practice is focused on OFAC [the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control] sanctions, so one particular area of concern is whether this new law will impede the efforts of companies to ensure that they are in compliance with OFAC sanctions,"" Gibson Dunn's Lee says. ""This usually involves 'screening' the personal information of customers, suppliers, employees, and business partners against a number of prohibited party lists.

""Sometimes, this screening function is performed outside of China. If companies violate OFAC sanctions, there can be really significant civil monetary penalties, so US companies are worried about being caught in the crossfire of the laws of the US and China, which can be conflicting.""

Whatever shape the final law takes, it is clear that many international organizations may have to staff up to handle at least some of the law's provisions. For example, the law requires data handlers outside of China that process the personal information of Chinese citizens to establish a dedicated entity or appoint a representative within China to be responsible for matters related to their information processing."

As with any business software decision, the password manager discussion starts with requirements, specifically regarding features. Determining which features are critical to your business isn’t necessarily difficult. It starts with knowing what features are available in the business password manager space so you have something to compare against. Not all business password managers have feature parity with each other; in some cases it’s not even close. Each offers features that should bring value to your business and enhance the security posture of your users.

Enterprise password manager features to look for

For starters, businesses will need administrative capabilities to manage multiple users and applications. Some vendors covered here include capabilities to automatically provision and de-provision user access to applications based on their group membership. Tools to manage password policies are a must-have and should include the ability to manage complexity rules and change requirements.

Password managers for business should fill some of the same needs as those designed for individual use, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) or even passwordless authentication. MFA is a key feature for both personal and business accounts because it forms the basis of securing all your various accounts. (Think of it like a lock box for physical keys.)

Other authentication capabilities you should look for in a business password manager are squarely business features. Things like the ability to synchronize with LDAP or Active Directory or the option to leverage authentication from cloud services like Office 365 or Google Workspace are features that could streamline deployment of the password manager to your users.

Some business password managers have more advanced authentication capabilities. We’re talking about the ability to handle authentication using the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) standard, a step above simply filling login form fields, and dynamic authentication policies that can make sure your users are using a registered device or are attempting to log in from an accepted geographic location. Some vendors even support capabilities like password management for VPN software, on-premises apps, or RADIUS servers.

Things like audit logging, reports, and alerts aren’t exactly the sexiest features of any software tool. They are key capabilities for a password manager focused on business users whether you’re monitoring app usage, auditing administrative actions, or simply looking to get a read on what passwords are weak, have been re-used, or are due to be changed.

Nonrepudiation is a key term here: It’s the ability to prove that a particular user performed an action. Password managers are sometimes used to provide access to an application to multiple users with the same set of credentials, which prevents auditing within that application to be able to identify which user performed an action, making it vital that the password manager be able to track and report on which users accessed an application at a particular date and time. Alerts can help keep you in the know about known compromised accounts, when user accounts are locked, or potentially when anomalous behavior is detected.

One more feature which may be a little bit on the niche side involves tooling to support accessing passwords programmatically with scripts. Secrets management is a real concern in the DevOps world, as hard-coded credentials are almost as bad as those stored in plain text. Command-line tools or the ability to access password vaults using an application programming interface (API) are common methods password management tools can offer to securely retrieve passwords from your vault, but secrets management could also involve native support for common tools like Kubernetes or Ansible.

The top enterprise password managers

Which vendors offer password management for businesses and bring enough features to the table to warrant consideration? Here are the ones worth looking at.

1Password

1Password is one of the more established names in the password manager arena, and in addition to their personal password management services they also offer solutions for teams, business, and enterprise. The teams tier offers admin controls for sharing and permissions, two-factor authentication (including support for Duo integration), and five guest accounts to extend secure sharing reach for $19.95 monthly. Customers of the business tier are looking at a $7.99 monthly cost per user, but gain policy-based administrative security controls, logging and reports, and provisioning through Active Directory, Okta, or OneLogin. Starting at $29 monthly 1Password also offers a Secrets Automation add-on for secrets management that supports a variety of tools including Andible, Kubernetes, HashiCorp Terraform and Vault, and code libraries for Go, NodeJS, and Python.

Dashlane

Dashlane is another popular password manager choice for personal use that successfully bridges the gap to the business world. Like 1Password, Dashlane offers both a teams and business tier, for $5 or $8 monthly per user, respectively. Aside from a suite of administrative management tools and reporting capabilities, Dashlane also supports both provisioning and de-provisioning of apps (including remote removal of company credentials). Dashlane also offers SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) for users of their business tier, directory integration, and policy-based management.

Keeper Business and Keeper Enterprise

Keeper Security boasts the most popular mobile apps of any password manager, and its individual accounts and apps compare well with the competition in that space. Like much of the competition who offer password management solutions for business, Keeper offers both a business and enterprise tier starting at $45 annually per user. The business tier offers policy-based management, reporting, and two-factor authentication, while enterprise customers gain SAML support, more robust two-factor (DUO integration and RSA tokens), command-line provisioning tools, and API support for things like password rotation and basic interaction with your vault. An add-on is available for more advanced reporting and alerting for $10 per user each year.

LastPass

LastPass is something of the big name in the group. Its business solution offers an intuitive admin interface with security policies, MFA settings, and reporting. Federation from Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) or Okta couples nicely with built-in provisioning and de-provisioning to streamline your administrative workflow. LastPass for business is available for $6 monthly per user, but limits you to three SSO apps, which is a pretty serious handicap. The Advanced SSO add-on gives you unlimited apps for an additional $2 per month for each user, and the Advanced MFA lends some serious power and flexibility to the authentication process for $3 monthly. Business customers can bundle with both add-ons for $9 monthly per user all told.

NordPass

NordPass is made by the same folks as NordVPN, which just means they have experience and something of an established reputation when it comes to privacy and security. Not gonna lie though, NordPass business could use some maturing, particularly on things like directory integration, MFA options, and reporting. Not that NordPass doesn’t offer options for each of these categories; it’s just that they don’t offer a lot of flexibility or depth compared to the competition. Business accounts start at $3.59 per user monthly, with enterprise tiers requiring a call to the sales team.

Password Boss

Password Boss may not be as well known as other vendors on this list, but it offers a business solution that’s worth at least a cursory look. Connectors for both Active Directory and Azure AD are available to help onboard your users, and MFA support is available using Google Authenticator or another time-based one-time password (TOTP) authenticator. While certainly not as sophisticated or mature as some of the other solutions on this list, if you’re looking for a simple, straightforward password manager Password Boss may fit your business needs nicely.

Securden

Securden is another name you may not have heard of, but it has a few different solutions for business account security, including their password manager for enterprises. Securden’s password manager has a long list of features including a robust array of admin tools like the typical group-based management and reporting, but it extends beyond that. Securden offers request-based permission workflows, where a user must request access to a resource and have it approved prior to authenticating to the resource. This not only ensures users are authorized but provides an additional audit point. Securden also offers automatic password rotation, API access, management of Windows service accounts, and even SSH key and secrets management. If that wasn’t enough Securden will integrate with your corporate Active Directory or SAML-based SSO solution, as well as your existing security information and event management (SIEM) and helpdesk ticketing systems."

T-Mobile breach timeline

Sunday, August 15: Hackers claim to be selling 100 million stolen T-Mobile records on cybercrime forum

News broke on Vice.com of hackers claiming to have accessed data relating to over 100 million people, which they were offering sale. While the underground forum post did not mention T-Mobile specifically, a message to Motherboard confirmed that the information came from T-Mobile servers and included SSNs, phone numbers, names, physical addresses, IMEI numbers, and driver's license information. Motherboard confirmed this to be accurate.

The seller was asking for 6 bitcoin (around $270,000) for a subset of the data containing 30 million SSNs and driver's licenses and said that they were looking to sell the remaining information privately. In a statement to Motherboard, T-Mobile said: “We are aware of claims made in an underground forum and have been actively investigating their validity. We do not have any additional information to share at this time.”

Monday, August 16: T-Mobile confirms data breach and begins technical review of the incident

With news of the incident making headlines around the globe, T-Mobile issued a statement confirming that unauthorized access to some T-Mobile data had occurred, though investigations were yet to determine if any personal customer information was involved. “We have been working around the clock to investigate claims being made that T-Mobile data may have been illegally accessed. We take the protection of our customers very seriously and we are conducting an extensive analysis alongside digital forensic experts to understand the validity of these claims, and we are coordinating with law enforcement.”

The company said it was confident that the entry point used to gain access had been closed, and that it was continuing its deep technical review of the situation across systems to identify the nature of any data that was illegally accessed. “This investigation will take some time but we are working with the highest degree of urgency. Until we have completed this assessment, we cannot confirm the reported number of records affected or the validity of statements made by others,” the statement read.

Tuesday, August 17: T-Mobile says data breach affected approximately 7.8 million current customers and 40 million records of former or prospective customers. Company takes steps to help protect individuals at risk from cyberattack

T-Mobile issued an update on its ongoing investigation into the breach, including estimations of individuals affected and remediation steps it was taking. “Late last week we were informed of claims made in an online forum that a bad actor had compromised T-Mobile systems. We immediately began an exhaustive investigation into these claims and brought in world-leading cybersecurity experts to help with our assessment.”

T-Mobile said it located and immediately closed the access point it believed was used to illegally gain entry to its servers, and while its investigation was still underway, it confirmed that the data stolen included some personal information. “We have no indication that the data contained in the stolen files included any customer financial information, credit card information, debit or other payment information,” it said. “Some of the data accessed did include customers’ first and last names, date of birth, SSN, and driver’s license/ID information for a subset of current and former postpaid customers and prospective T-Mobile customers.” The company also confirmed that approximately 850,000 active T-Mobile prepaid customer names, phone numbers, and account PINs were exposed.

T-Mobile said it would be issuing communications to advise customers on next steps and recommended action to avoid falling victim to follow-on attacks. This included the offer of two years of free identity protection services and advice that all T-Mobile postpaid customers should change their PIN. “This precaution is despite the fact that we have no knowledge that any postpaid account PINs were compromised,” it added. T-Mobile also offered an extra step to protect mobile accounts with its Account Takeover Protection capabilities for postpaid customers and said it would be publishing a unique webpage for information and solutions to help customers take steps to further protect themselves.

Wednesday, August 18: Security researcher Brian Krebs advises customers to follow T-Mobile advice and warns of follow-on phishing attacks

Security researcher Brian Krebs advised T-Mobile customers to change their PIN as instructed by T-Mobile, but also advocated removing phone numbers from as many online accounts as possible. “Many online services require you to provide a phone number upon registering an account, but in many cases that number can be removed from your profile afterwards.” Many online services allow users to reset their passwords just by clicking a link sent via SMS, and this widespread practice has turned mobile phone numbers into de facto identity documents, he added. This creates the possibility of losing control over phone numbers “thanks to an unauthorized SIM swap or mobile number port-out, divorce, job termination or financial crisis can be devastating.”

Krebs also warned customers to be on the lookout for related phishing attacks, adding that it is a safe bet that scammers will use some of the exposed information to target T-Mobile users with phishing messages, account takeovers, and harassment. “T-Mobile customers should expect to see phishers taking advantage of public concern over the breach to impersonate the company — and possibly even messages that include the recipient’s compromised account details to make the communications look more legitimate.”

Friday, August 20: T-Mobile says another 5.3 million existing customers and 667,000 former customers affected by breach

With T-Mobile’s data breach investigation ongoing, the company issued an updated statement detailing another 5.3 million current postpaid customer accounts that had one or more associated customer names, addresses, date of births, phone numbers, International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) and International Mobile Subscriber Identifier (IMSI) numbers illegally accessed. “We also previously reported that data files with information from about 40 million former or prospective T-Mobile customers, including first and last names, date of birth, SSN, and driver’s license/ID information, were compromised. We have since identified an additional 667,000 accounts of former T- Mobile customers that were accessed with customer names, phone numbers, addresses and dates of birth compromised. These additional accounts did not have any SSNs or driver’s license/ID information compromised.” T-Mobile reiterated its confidence that it has closed off the access and egress points the bad actor used in the attack.

Sunday, August 22: T-Mobile faces pair of lawsuits in wake of data breach

T-Mobile was issued two lawsuits following the breach of its data. The first, Espanoza v. T-Mobile USA, claimed that the company put plaintiffs at risk over its failure to adequately protect customers as a result of negligent conduct. “As a result of the data breach, plaintiffs and class members are exposed to a heightened present and imminent risk of fraud and identity theft,” the complaint read.

The second, Durwalla v T-Mobile USA, stated that T-Mobile “failed to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information to protect its customers’ personal information, yet again putting millions of customers at great risk of scams and identity theft.” Both suits seek various actions for violations of the Washington Consumer Protection Act and the California Consumer Privacy Act, including compensation and reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs for efforts to repair any damage caused by the data breach.

Thursday, August 26: 21-year-old American claims to be behind T-Mobile hack, criticizes “awful” security

In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, a 21-year-old American man living in Turkey claimed to be responsible for the attack on T-Mobile. According to the report, John Binns told reporters that he originally gained access to T-Mobile’s network in July via an unprotected router. “I was panicking because I had access to something big. Their security is awful. Generating noise was one goal,” he is quoted as saying. The attack was apparently carried out in retaliation of how Binns has been treated by US law enforcement agencies in recent years. It remains uncertain whether he acted alone, part of a group, or if any of the stolen data has been sold thus far."

The number of ransomware threat actors—those capable of developing and delivering code—is likely in the hundreds. That’s not including so-called “affiliates” who buy ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) offerings from some of these threat actors.

Below is a list of key ransomware malware and groups, selected for inclusion based on their impact or innovative features. It isn't, and isn't intended to be, an exhaustive list. While some of these ransomware groups are no longer active, that’s no guarantee they won’t reappear bigger and badder someday, as is too often the case.

Cerber

History: Cerber is an RaaS platform that first appeared in 2016, netting attackers $200,000 in July of that year.

How it works: Cerber took advantage of a Microsoft vulnerability to infect networks. It functions similarly to other ransomware threats. It encrypts files with AES-256 algorithm and targets dozens of file types, including documents, pictures, audio files, videos, archives and backups. It can also scan for and encrypt available network shares even if they are not mapped to a drive letter in the computer. Cerber then drops three files on the victim's desktop that contain the ransom demand and instructions on how to pay it.

Targeted victims: As an RaaS platform, Cerber is a threat to anyone.

Attribution: Cerber's creators sell the platform on a private Russian-language forum.

Conti

History: First appearing in May 2020, the Conti RaaS platform is considered the successor to the Ryuk ransomware. As of January 2021, Conti is believed to have infected over 150 organizations and earned millions of dollars for its criminal developers and their affiliates. At least three new versions have been found since its inception.

How it works: Conti uses the double threat of withholding the decryption key and selling or leaking sensitive data of its victims. In fact, it runs a website, Conti News, where it lists its victims and publishes stolen data. Once the malware infects a system, it spends time moving laterally to gain access to more sensitive systems. Conti is known to encrypt files quickly through its use of multithreading.

Targeted victims: As a RaaS operation, Conti is a threat to anyone, although a round of infections in January 2021 seemed to target government organizations. The Wizard Spider group is believed to have used Conti in its ransomware attack on Ireland's national health service and at least 16 US-based healthcare and emergency networks.

Attribution: Conti is the work of a single gang whose members remain unidentified.

CryptoLocker

History: First discovered in 2013 attack, CryptoLocker launched the modern ransomware age and infected up to 500,000 Windows machines at its height. It is also known as TorrentLocker. In July 2014, the US Department of Justice declared it had “neutralized” CryptoLocker.

How it works: CryptoLocker is a Trojan that searches infected computers for files to encrypt, including any internal or network-connected storage devices. It typically is delivered through phishing emails with file attachments that contain malicious links. A downloader is activated once the file is opened, infecting the computer.

Targeted victims: CryptoLocker did not seem to target any specific entity.

Attribution: CryptoLocker was created by members of the criminal gang that developed Gameover Zeus, a banking Trojan.

CryptoWall

History: CryptoWall, also known as CryptoBit or CryptoDefense, first appeared in 2014 and became popular after the original CryptoLocker shut down. It has gone through several revisions.

How it works: CryptoWall is distributed via spam or exploit kits. Its developers appear to avoid sophisticated in favor of a simple but effective classic ransomware approach. In its first six months of operation, it infected 625,000 computers.

Targeted victims: This ransomware has victimized tens of thousands of organizations of all types worldwide but avoids Russian-speaking countries.

Attribution: The CryptoWall developer is likely a criminal gang operating from a Russian-speaking country. CryptoWall 3.0 detects if it is running on a computer in Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, Armenia or Serbia then uninstalls itself.

CTB-Locker

History: First reported in 2014, CTB-Locker is another RaaS offering known for its high infection rate. In 2016, a new version of CTB-Locker targeted web servers.

How it works: Affiliates pay a monthly fee to the CTB-Locker developers for access to the hosted ransomware code. The ransomware uses elliptic curve cryptography to encrypt data. It is also known for its multi-lingual capabilities, which increases the global pool of potential victims.

Targeted victims: Given its RaaS model, CTB-Locker is a threat to any organization, but tier 1 countries in Western Europe, North America and Australia are most commonly targeted, especially if they were known to have paid ransom fees in the past.

DarkSide

History: In operation since at least August 2020, DarkSide jumped into the public spotlight in May 2021 with the ransomware attack that crippled Colonial Pipeline.

How it works: DarkSide works on the RaaS model through an affiliate program. It uses the double-extortion threat of data encryption and data theft. It is typically deployed using manual hacking techniques.

DarkSide's operators seem media savvy. They run a website where reporters can register to receive advance information about breaches and non-public information and promises fast replies to any media questions.

Targeted victims: The group behind DarkSide claims that it doesn't attack medical facilities, COVID vaccine research and distribution companies, funeral services, non-profit organizations, educational institutions, or government organizations. After the Colonial Pipeline attack, the group issued a statement saying it would review its affiliates' potential victims before they launced attacks.

Attribution: The DarkSide group is believed to operate from Russia and likely former affiliates of the REvil group.

DoppelPaymer

History: DoppelPaymer first appeared in June 2019 and is still active and dangerous. The US FBI's Cyber Division issued a warning about it in December 2020. In September 2020, it was used in the first ransomware that resulted in a death when a a victimized German hospital was forced to send a patient to another facility.

How it works: The gang behind DoppelPaymer uses the unusual tactic of calling victims, using spoofed US-based phone numbers, to demand a ransom payment, which is typically around 50 bitcoins, or about $600,000 when it first appeared. They claimed to be from North Korea, and made the double threat of leaking or selling the stolen data. In some cases, they took it a step further by threatening employees at victimized companies with harm.

DoppelPaymer appears to be based on the BitPaymer ransomware, although it has some key differences such as using threaded file encryption for a better encryption rate. Also unlike BitPaymer, DoppelPaymer uses a tool called Process Hacker to terminate security, email server, backup and database processes and services to weaken defenses and avoid disrupting the encryption process.

Targeted victims: DoppelPaymer targets critical industries in healthcare, emergency services and education.

Attribution: Unclear, but some reports suggest that an offshoot of the group behind the Dridex Trojan, known as TA505, is responsible for DoppelPaymer.

Egregor

History: Egregor appeared in September 2020 and is growing rapidly. Its name comes from the occult world and is defined as “the collective energy of a group of people, especially when aligned with a common goal.” On February 9, 2021, a joint operation by US, Ukrainian and French authorities arrested a number of Egregor group members and affiliates and took their website offline.

How it works: Egregor follows the “double extortion” trend of both encrypting data and threatening to leak sensitive information if the ransom is not paid. Its codebase is relatively sophisticated and able to avoid detection by using obfuscation and anti-analysis techniques.

Targeted victims: As of late November, Egregor victimized at least 71 organizations across 19 industries worldwide.

Attribution: Egregor’s rise coincides with the Maze ransomware gang shutting down its operations. Maze group affiliates appear to have moved on to Egregor. It is a variant of the Sekhmet ransomware family and is associated with the Qakbot malware.

FONIX

History: FONIX is an RaaS offering that was first discovered in July 2020. It quickly went through a number of code revisions, but abruptly shut down in January 2021. The FONIX gang then released its master decryption key.

How it works: The FONIX gang advertised its services on cybercrime forums and the dark web. Purchasers of FONIX would send the gang an email address and password. The gang then sends the customized ransomware payload to the buyer. The FONIX gang takes a 25% cut of any ransom fees paid.

Targeted victims: Since FONIX is RAAS, anyone could be a victim.

Attribution: An unknown cybercriminal gang

GandCrab

History: GandCrab might be the most lucrative RaaS ever. Its developers claim more than $2 billion in victim payouts as of July 2019. GandCrab was first identified in January 2018.

How it works: GandCrab is an affiliate ransomware program for cybercriminals who pay its developers a portion of the ransom fees they collect. The malware is typically delivered through malicious Microsoft Office documents sent via phishing emails. Variations of GandCrab have exploited vulnerabilities in software such as Atlassian’s Confluence. In that case, the attackers use the flaw to inject a rogue template that enables remote code execution.

Targeted victims: GandCrab has infected systems globally across multiple industries, though it is designed to avoid systems in Russian-speaking regions.

Attribution: GandCrab has been tied to Russian national Igor Prokopenko.

GoldenEye

History: Appearing in 2016, GoldenEye appears to be based on the Petya ransomware.

How it works: GoldenEye was initially spread through a campaign targeting human resources departments with fake cover letters and resumes. Once its payload infects a computer, it executes a macro that encrypts files on the computer, adding a random 8-character extension at the end of each file. The ransomware then modifies the computer’s hard drive master boot record with a custom boot loader.

Targeted victims: GoldenEye first targeted German-speaking users in its phishing emails.

Attribution: Unknown

Jigsaw

History: Jigsaw first appeared in 2016, but researchers released a decryption tool shortly after its discovery.

How it works: The most notable aspect of Jigsaw is that it encrypts some files, demands a ransom, and then progressively deletes files until the ransom is paid. It deletes a file per hour for 72 hours. At that point, it deletes all remaining files.

Targeted victims: Jigsaw appears not to have target any group of victims.

Attribution: Unknown

KeRanger

History: KeRanger, discovered in 2016, is believed to be the first operational ransomware designed to attack Mac OS X applications.

How it works: KeRanger was distributed through a legitimate but compromised BitTorrent client that was able to evade detection as it had a valid certificate.

Targeted victims: Mac users

Attribution: Unknown

Leatherlocker

History: Leatherlocker was first discovered in 2017 in two Android applications: Booster & Cleaner and Wallpaper Blur HD. Google removed the apps from its store shortly after discovery.

How it works: Victims download what appears to be a legitimate app. The app then asks for permissions that grant the malware access needed to execute. Rather than encrypt files, it locks the device home screen to prevent access to data.

Targeted victims: Android users who download the infected apps.

Attribution: An unknown cybercriminal group.

LockerGoga

History: LockerGoga appeared in 2019 in an attack targeting industrial companies. Although the attackers asked for a ransom, LockerGoga seemed intentially designed to make paying a ransom difficult. This led some researcher to believe its intent was disruption rather than financial gain.

How it works: LockerGoga used a phishing campaign with malicious document attachments to infect systems. The payload were signed with valid certificates, which allowed them to bypass security.

Targeted victims: LockerGoga victimized European manufacturing companies, most notably Norsk Hydro where it caused a global IT shut-down.

Attribution: Some researchers say LockerGoga was likely the work of a nation-state.

Locky

History: Locky first began spreading in 2016 and used an attack mode similar to the banking malware Dridex. Locky has inspired a number of variants including Osiris and Diablo6."

Those efforts include increasing the cybersecurity talent pool, boosting security awareness, and better securing the software supply chain. Microsoft pledged $20 billion and Google pledge $10 billion to develop more advanced security solutions in areas such as security by design, zero-trust, software supply chain, and open-source software.

That announcement came at a meeting hosted by the Biden Administration yesterday where private sector leaders met with national security and cabinet team members to tackle the nation's cybersecurity problems. Among the attendees from the government were:

Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo

Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas

SBA Administrator Isabel Guzman

National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan

Director of the National Economic Council Brian Deese

Senior Advisor and Director of the Office of Public Engagement Cedric Richmond

Deputy National Security Advisor for Cyber and Emerging Technology Anne Neuberger

National Cyber Director Chris Inglis

Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Director Jen Easterly

Tech industry attendees included Carlos Rodriguez, President and CEO of ADP, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet, Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon, Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, Dr. Arvind Krishna, Chair and CEO of IBM and Satya Nadella, Chair and CEO of Microsoft. The CEOs of Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, TIAA, and US Bancorp represented the financial industry at the meeting. The CEOs of four leading insurance companies also attended, as did the CEOs of seven water and energy companies. Five leaders from the education community rounded out the group.

The meeting participants broke out into three separate sessions. The first was Critical Infrastructure Resilience, chaired by Secretary Mayorkas and Secretary Granholm and attended by the financial, energy, and water executives. The second session, Building Enduring Cybersecurity, was chaired by Secretary Raimondo and SBA Administrator Guzman and attended by the high-tech and insurance executives. Education leaders attended the third session, devoted to the cybersecurity workforce and chaired by National Cyber Director Inglis.

Federal government can't meet challenge alone

President Biden kicked off the meeting by recapping his administration's cybersecurity efforts. Since January, the administration's has, among other things, launched a 100-day initiative to improve cybersecurity across the electric sector, ordered the creation of a framework to upgrade software security, and began a campaign to get G7 countries to hold nations that harbor ransomware threat actors accountable.

Biden also noted that he held a summit with Vladimir Putin and ""made it clear to him that we expected him to hold them accountable as well because they know where they are and who they are. But that's another issue we will not be discussing so much today.""

Biden told the high-powered attendees, “The reality is, most of our critical infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector, and the federal government can't meet this challenge alone. I've invited you all here today because you have the power, the capacity, and the responsibility, I believe, to raise the bar on cybersecurity.""

Skilled cybersecurity workforce not growing fast enough

One issue that keeps the bar lower than it should be is the shortage of qualified professionals, which was a major focus of the event. ""Our skilled cybersecurity workforce has not grown fast enough to keep pace,"" Biden said in his remarks.

The administration estimates that around 500,000 cybersecurity jobs currently go unfilled in the US. As one step toward narrowing the skills gap, at least in the federal government, the Department of Homeland Security separately published yesterday in the federal register the Cybersecurity Talent Management System (CTMS). This new compensation system raises the top federal cybersecurity annual pay to $255,800, the current vice president's salary, with escalations beyond that under certain circumstances.

Broad array of steps promised

After the meeting, the White House unveiled an array of steps that the attendees pledged to take to improve the information and technology security landscape including:

A collaboration between the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and industry and other players to improve the security and integrity of the technology supply chain, including open-source software. Microsoft, Google, and insurance companies Travelers and Coalition say they are committed to participating in this NIST-led initiative.

The formal expansion of the Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity Initiative beyond electric utilities to include natural gas pipelines.

A new program by Apple to drive continuous security improvements throughout the technology supply chain. Apple also said it would work with its suppliers. including more than 9,000 in the United States, to drive the mass adoption of multi-factor authentication, security training, vulnerability remediation, event logging, and incident response

A $10 billion investment by Google over the next five years to expand zero-trust programs, help secure the software supply chain, and enhance open-source security. Google also said it would help 100,000 Americans earn industry-recognized digital skills certificates that provide the knowledge that can lead to secure high-paying, high-growth jobs.

IBM said it would train 150,000 people in cybersecurity skills over the next three years and partner with more than 20 historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) to establish cybersecurity leadership centers to grow a more diverse cyber workforce.

Microsoft said it would spend $20 billion over the next five years to accelerate integrating cybersecurity by design and delivering advanced security solutions. The Redmond giant said it would also make available $150 million in technical services to help federal, state, and local governments upgrade security protection and expand partnerships with community colleges and non-profits for cybersecurity training.

Amazon promised it would make available to the public at no charge the security awareness training it offers its employees. In addition, Amazon will also offer Amazon Web Services account holders at no additional cost a multi-factor authentication device to protect against cybersecurity threats.

Cybersecurity insurance provider Resilience said it would require policyholders to meet a threshold of cybersecurity best practice as a condition of receiving coverage. Another insurance provider, Coalition, will make its cybersecurity risk assessment and continuous monitoring platform available for free to any organization.

org, a non-profit dedicated to expanding access to computer science in schools, promised to teach cybersecurity concepts to over three million students across 35,000 classrooms over three years, train a diverse population of students to stay safe online, and build interest in cybersecurity as a potential career.

The University of Texas (UT) System said it plans to expand existing programs and develop new short-term credentials in cyber-related fields to strengthen America's cybersecurity workforce. The UT System aims to upskill or reskill over one million workers across the nation by making available entry-level cyber educational programs through UT San Antonio's Cybersecurity Manufacturing Innovation Institute.

Finally, Whatcom Community College in Bellingham, Washington, announced it had been designated the new National Science Foundation Advanced Technological Education National Cybersecurity Center. It would provide cybersecurity education and training to faculty and support program development for colleges to ""fast-track"" students from college to career.

This latest development in the Biden administration’s continued cybersecurity campaign prompted praise by at least one important lawmaker. ""For years I have been calling for more sustained leadership from the White House on cybersecurity, and President Biden is demonstrating the strong leadership we need to meet the challenge,"" Jim Langevin, co-chair of the Congressional Cybersecurity Caucus and a member of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission, said in a statement. ""The President's cybersecurity summit today continues his unprecedented string of major cyber initiatives in just his first seven months on the job."""

However, without proper input validation and safeguards in place, your application can be vulnerable to unsafe deserialization vulnerabilities.

In a best-case scenario, deserialization vulnerabilities may simply cause data corruption or application crashes, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition. Many times, the same bugs can be triggered by remote attackers to achieve arbitrary code execution capability on the vulnerable system.

What is serialization in Java?

Serialization refers to the process of saving an object's state as a sequence of bytes and conversely, deserialization is the process of rebuilding those bytes back into an object.

Say you just developed an application that reads and writes data locally, such as from files present on a system. Or you built an application that sends and receives data across a network. What’s the best way to do this while preserving the integrity of the data?

As far as storage is concerned, the choice to store data in files or databases remains up to the developer. Even then, when it comes to transmitting data over a network, you’d have to pick an appropriate data format and encoding mechanism that “standardizes” data and is preferably platform independent.

Many solutions exist, including manually converting binary or text data into its simple base64 ASCII form and decoding it. But why reinvent the wheel to implement a data encoding and decoding mechanism? Java’s inbuilt concept of serialization, does all this for you, for the very objects created by your application that are still in memory.

The Java Serialization API provides a standard mechanism for developers to handle object serialization.

For example, say you have a “Person” class in Java that contains fields containing an individual’s personal information, such as “name,” “email address,” “phone number,” and “address.” If you wanted to offer a “save” option to your users, you could either choose to iterate over the “Person” object, convert each field into an appropriate format, such as JSON or CSV, and output it to a file.

If you don’t care about the human-readable aspect of the resulting file and merely want to store this data for retrieval by your application later, serialization can save you enormous time. With serialization, you can simply dump the “Person” object or an array (list) of multiple “Person” objects into a file with a single command. The encoding of data is taken care of by Java’s inbuilt serialization libraries.

What makes serialization an appealing solution for developers is that storage, retrieval, and transmission of data becomes possible with a single command and without worrying about the underlying logic or platform. Naturally, then, many applications and developers rely on serialization to store data and the very state of objects as it is.

A simple example of a “Person” class that supports serialization would be:

Ax Sharma

How unsafe object deserialization vulnerabilities occur

Say your Java application was deserializing data from a file or network stream and retrieving previously serialized “Person” objects from it. Should your application be expecting a “Person” object, but instead receives an “Animal” object—either in error or deliberately due to malicious activity, what happens?

In most cases, an error message may occur crashing the application, which ends up in a DoS condition triggered by corrupted data. In more advanced cases, depending on how the objects are being used, closely related classes may be able to trigger remote code execution (RCE). This can, for example, happen when the application was expecting to receive “configuration” data or payload containing serialized Java objects.

For example, in July this year, a critical vulnerability (CVE-2021-35464) in ForgeRock’s OpenAM stemmed from unsafe Java deserialization in the Jato framework used by the application. Through a simple GET request, an attacker could send a crafted serialized object to the server and execute their malicious code. A PoC exploit demonstrated by PortSwigger researcher Michael Stepankin explains this in detail.



http://server.example.com/openam/oauth2/..;/ccversion/Version?jato.pageSession=<serialized_object>

More recently, Atlassian began emailing enterprise customers to patch a critical JIRA Data Center vulnerability, CVE-2020-36239, that could let remote attackers execute arbitrary code on vulnerable servers. The cause of the vulnerability? Unsafe deserialization and exposed ports. An attacker could send crafted payload to the exposed Ehcache RMI network service ports 40001 and potentially 40011 and achieve code execution.

Deserialization vulnerabilities don’t affect only Java apps

Java is not the only programming language affected by unsafe deserialization vulnerabilities. Microsoft .NET languages also support serialization, which means inadequately secured .NET applications that deserialize data could pose a risk.

Not too long ago, a threat actor group called Praying Mantis (TG1021) was targeting IIS servers running vulnerable ASP.NET applications. A zero-day in ASP.NET application “Checkbox” let remote attackers execute arbitrary code that stemmed from unsafe deserialization.

With so many Java and .NET applications relying on serialization for storing and exchanging information, a greater risk surface is available to threat actors when applications lack basic input sanitization or are hosted on insufficiently secure servers (such as exposed ports or improperly authenticated API endpoints).

How to protect against unsafe deserialization?

An obvious approach is to perform basic input sanitization when parsing objects from a deserialized byte stream. Another essential ingredient to preventing unsafe deserialization attacks is to allow only certain types (classes) of objects to be deserialized. This eliminates any ambiguity faced by your application and is an elegant way of dodging application crashes or the possibility of DoS attacks.

There are two ways of doing this: Follow a blacklist approach—i.e., explicitly forbidding objects of certain classes from being deserialized—or a more restrictive, whitelist approach. Although restrictive, the whitelist approach tends to be safer, as only the objects belonging to a pre-approved set of classes will be deserialized by the application, preventing any surprises.

Popular Java project Jackson Databind has previously implemented both types of fixes against deserialization flaws. For the longest time the project went with a more permissible blacklist approach and would simply add forbidden gadgets/classes to the same list from time to time:

Ax Sharma

However, newer fixes follow a more selective whitelist approach by introducing a “PolymorphicTypeValidator” class. Only objects of classes belonging to the list will be deserialized. Here’s an example of how this class can be done in practice:

Ax Sharma



The example code shown would allow only the “com.gypsyengineer.jackson” type of objects to be deserialized.

Whatever approach you choose to use, the basic tenet here remains to never trust input, even when it appears to come from authoritative sources or an application (rather than a user). Performing basic sanitization checks prior to processing an input can help prevent a major exploitation.

For interested researchers and pen-testers, a GitHub repository called ysoserial contains a collection of utilities and property-oriented programming gadget chains typically found in common Java libraries. Under the right conditions, these gadget chains could aid in conducting unsafe deserialization attacks—a reasonable way to check if your Java application could be exploited via insecure deserialization by advanced threat actors."

Others see it as “an explicit call to action to start including security from the beginning of the software development life cycle,” the report noted.

The figures, the Puppet report concluded, confirm that “good security practices and better security outcomes are enabled by devops practices.
As devops practices improve, devsecops naturally follows.”","Devops has become common in software-development organizations around the world, but many companies are still struggling with cultural issues that are dampening security practitioners’ influence in the devsecops practices crucial for next-generation cloud application development.

When it’s done well, devops is driving dramatic change—with GitLab’s recently released 2021 devsecops survey of nearly 4,300 respondents finding that the COVID-19 pandemic had “energized teams to focus on embracing cutting-edge devops technologies” including Kubernetes, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cloud computing.

Broader adoption of devops-related capabilities had sped up software development, with 84% of developers saying they are releasing new software faster than ever—and one in five saying they are releasing new code 10 times faster, the GitLab survey showed.

The challenges of adopting devsecops

Yet while developers had naturally warmed to new and faster development processes, this new speed was creating paradoxical challenges around the adoption of devsecops, which is still seen by many as obstructing speed of delivery even though security mandates have become more important than ever. “In the past year, devops matured and fully arrived with these technology adoptions,” the report noted, “but there are still roadblocks to navigate before achieving true devsecops.”

Security testing remains an obstacle, with 42% of respondents to the GitLab survey saying security testing was happening too late in the development process. A similar proportion said they found it difficult to process and fix security vulnerabilities.

Nonetheless, 72% of surveyed security professionals said their organizations were putting in either “good” or “strong” efforts around security—up from 59% the year before.

With lingering confusion over issues like who is in charge of security, GitLab vice president of security Johnathan Hunt said, “a more clear delineation of responsibilities and adoption of new tools is required to completely shift security left.”

Long-standing challenges in devops persist in devsecops

The report validates predictions by analyst firm Gartner, which in 2020 predicted that 75% of devops initiatives would fail to meet expectations due to ongoing issues around organizational learning and change.

A recent survey by cybersecurity vendor Vectra AI of 317 IT executives identified some of the most problematic issues, with nearly one-third of surveyed companies still having no formal sign-off on new software versions before pushing them into production.

With 64% of companies deploying new services weekly or even more frequently, this lack of security review threatens overall security, Vector AI said, warning of “blind spots” that were only getting larger as companies expanded their investments in cloud platforms. “The cloud has expanded so much that securely configuring it with continued confidence is nearly impossible,” the company said, noting that “risk exponentially increases as more people are granted access to the [cloud] environment.”

Interestingly, some regions are feeling the drag more than others. Just 37% of Asia-Pacific respondents to Puppet’s 2021 State of Devops Report, for example, said culture was a barrier to the evolution of devops practices in their organization—well below the 47% global average—while 23% said that technology was more of an issue.

A “very specific set of challenges” were seen as cultural factors impeding progress to devops—including cultures that discourage risk, have unclear responsibilities, deprioritize fast flow optimization, and fail to include sufficient feedback loops. All create an accumulation of issues over time, potentially causing stagnation that causes many organizations to plateau after only completing part of their devops transformation.

There are two different schools of thought around devsecops, the Puppet report noted. Some people say that the term shouldn’t exist because security is fundamental to both development and operations. Others see it as “an explicit call to action to start including security from the beginning of the software development life cycle,” the report noted.

“For many organizations, the relationship between the security function and the design part of software development was even more distant than that between development and operations,” the report noted. “Symbols and labels can be a powerful way to drive change.”

Fully 51% of companies with highly developed devops cultures reported integrating security into requirements, while security was also being integrated into the design (61%), build (53%), and testing (52%) stages of the software development life cycle.

Companies with less-mature devops practices reported less security rigor, with 48% engaging security for scheduled audits of production and 45% doing so when there was an issue reported in production.

The figures, the Puppet report concluded, confirm that “good security practices and better security outcomes are enabled by devops practices. As devops practices improve, devsecops naturally follows.”"

As I watched the three-day event, it reminded me how unknown most of the technology behind computers is. A bit of disclosure: While I’ve analyzed computer systems and even testified in court about them, I would not consider myself an expert in all forensic circumstances. I can authoritatively discuss what a Windows event log looks like, but if I’m looking at a software that I’m not familiar with, I don’t know what its “normal” looks like.

Computer forensics is a combination of understanding exactly what a computer is doing, the evidence it leaves behind, what artifacts you are looking at, and whether you can come to a conclusion about what you are seeing. Packet capture expert Robert Graham said it best in a recent tweet:

Remember that's what we are trying to sift through: a world of things we don't understand that look suspicious as hell, and the world of things that we do understand that we can pin down exactly what happened.

Questions to ask before doing a forensic investigation

When an event occurs the first thing you should ask yourself these questions:

What did you plan on capturing before the event occurred?

Did you have event logging enabled and enhanced with Sysmon?

Do you know if the computers and systems you plan to sample are synchronized in time so that when you look at the log file of one device it will correlate with the timestamps of another device?

Do you know the normal traffic or behavior of the software you are looking at?

Do you know what websites or IP addresses are normal and baseline for that machine?

Why forensic images are different

Reviewing a computer system in a tool like FTK Imager can be daunting if you have never taken a forensic image of a computer system and seen it in its flat, raw form. You aren’t looking at the system in a bootable form. Rather, it is in hexadecimal or what I would call a flattened format, as you can see in the video below. You typically begin the review while the image is not booted. While you can use forensic tools to mount the forensic image and boot into it, it will need a password and you may not wish to reset or remove passwords.

The forensic analyst likely wants to analyze the data and save the booted virtual machine for any potential evidence in trial. When it comes to evidence, a picture is truly worth a thousand words in a courtroom.

Starting a forensic analysis of a disk image

To understand what FTK Imager is and can do, download and use it to make a copy of any sample computer. You’ll also need a supply of external USB hard drives or a network storage location. While you are learning, don’t worry about what a normal forensic examiner needs to do. Think about the end goal of a forensic examination when you begin it: You’ll want to come to a conclusion, so taking notes of what you observe will help the investigator write the report. Old-school examiners will just take a dd image of the drive, tools like FTK Imager have become a standard way to obtain the image of the drive and document the SHA hash value of the drive and its contents.

You can use FTK Imager to review the drive’s contents. Remember, because you are looking at the unbooted operating system, some information may take some analysis before you can determine what actions are going on. You’ll need to understand where the event logs are located as well as where log files for each application may be located.

Often this doesn’t tell the full story of what went on with a system. As we turn more to cloud services, you must review artifacts left behind in the browser to determine what went on with the cloud services.

Then you need to layer on the additional log files that will back up your analysis. Ideally you will find a firewall log file on the edge that will back up what you are seeing on the computer. If you suspect that a phishing attack let to a workstation takeover that then led to lateral movement and subsequently a full ransomware attack, there will be evidence in the firewall of IP addresses accessed and egress traffic to a command-and-control server. All this analysis takes a lot of understanding of how computers work as well as possibly recreating some of the sequences to confirm what you think is going on in your system.

Gathering packet captures is another task that needs planning. The typical tool used to analyze packets is Wireshark. Similar to imaging a system, understanding what Wireshark is telling you is requires knowing what is normal to your system and what is not.

A Windows 10 E5 license combined with Windows Advanced Threat Protection is yet another way to have a real-time forensic view of your computer system. The Microsoft Defender for Endpoints portal shows a console view of the activities going on with your computer. Once again, fully understanding what is going on in your computer can be confusing. In my own analyses computer systems, I often forget tasks or tools that I’ve installed and I’ve had to go back to my documentation to determine that I actually set up the questionable item I saw on the machine.

Bottom line, computer forensics take both time and evidentiary logs. Ensure that you’ve enabled your network to capture this information ahead of time. Logging should be enabled on devices and the logs stored and archived. Don’t do this project in front of a live audience. It takes time, skill, and investigation. Often it takes setting up testbeds and recreating actions to confirm what you think is going on."

The ransomware group has been active since at least November 2020 and has hit companies in the United States. Its members are aggressive in seeking the ransom, calling victims using spoofed telephone numbers and actively emailing them if they don't respond to the initial ransom note after one week.

Phishing leads to IceID and Cobalt Strike

The OnePercent group relies on the IceID Trojan for initial access into networks. IceID was originally designed to steal online banking credentials, but like many other so-called banking Trojans, it expanded into an access platform for ransomware groups. Similar relationships have been observed in the past between TrickBot banking Trojan and the Ryuk ransomware group, the Dridex Trojan and WastedLocker or Gootkit and REvil (Sodinokibi).

IceID is distributed through phishing emails that carry malicious zip attachments. The zip archives contain Word documents with malicious macros that, if allowed to execute, download and install IceID.

Following this initial infection, the attackers deploy Cobalt Strike, a commercial penetration testing agent that has become popular with many cybercriminals in recent years. Cobalt Strike is used to provide backdoor access to infected systems and move laterally through the network using PowerShell scripts.

The OnePercent toolset

Before encrypting data, the OnePercent attacks can spend a lot of time inside the victim's network, expanding their access and exfiltrating interesting data they find. ""The actors have been observed within the victim’s network for approximately one month prior to deployment of the ransomware,"" the FBI said in an alert published Monday.

During this time, they use a variety of open-source tools including the credential dumping program MimiKatz and the associated SharpKatz and BetterSafetyKatz, the SharpSploit post-exploitation library written in .NET and the rclone command-line utility. Rclone allows managing files on cloud services, and in this case it's used to exfiltrate data from victims. The FBI advises companies to add the hashes for the various rclone binaries to their malware detection programs.

Aggressive extortion

The OnePercent group's ransom note directs victims to a website hosted on the Tor anonymity network where they can see the ransom amount and contact the attackers via a live chat feature. The note also includes a Bitcoin address where the ransom must be paid.

If victims do not pay or contact the attackers within one week, the group attempts to contact them via phone calls and emails sent from ProtonMail addresses. ""The actors will persistently demand to speak with a victim company’s designated negotiator or otherwise threaten to publish the stolen data,"" the FBI said. ""When a victim company does not respond, the actors send subsequent threats to publish the victim company’s stolen data via the same ProtonMail email address.""

The extortion has different levels. If the victim does not agree to pay the ransom quickly, the group threatens to release a portion of the data publicly and if the ransom is not paid even after this, the attackers threaten to sell the data to the REvil/Sodinokibi group to be auctioned off.

Aside from the REvil connection, OnePercent might have been tied to other ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operations in the past too. Some of the OnePercent indicators of compromise and techniques published in the FBI advisory overlap IoCs published by FireEye in February for a group tracked as UNC2198.

Based on FireEye's analysis, UNC2198 intrusions go as far back as June 2020 and also involve the deployment of Maze and Egregor ransomware. OnePercent could therefore be what is known in the ransomware ecosystem as an affiliate—a group that handles the victim compromise and distribution of ransomware and shares part of the profit with the ransomware program's creators."

Your company's IP, whether that's patents, trade secrets or just employee know-how, may be more valuable than its physical assets. Security pros must understand the dark forces that are trying to get this information from your company and piece it together in a useful way. Some of these forces come in the guise of ""competitive intelligence"" researchers who, in theory, are governed by a set of legal and ethical guidelines carefully wrought by the Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals (SCIP).

IP protection is a complex duty with aspects that fall under the purview of legal, IT, human resources and other departments. Ultimately a chief security officer (CSO) or risk committee often serves to unify intellectual property protection efforts. With protection from cyber attack now critical, the chief information security officer (CISO) now plays a major role.

What is intellectual property?

IP can be anything from a particular manufacturing process to plans for a product launch, a trade secret like a chemical formula, or a list of the countries in which your patents are registered. It may help to think of it as intangible proprietary information. The World Intellectual Property Organization’s (WIPO’s) formal definition of IP is creations of the mind—inventions, literary and artistic works, symbols, names, images and designs used in commerce.

IP is divided into two categories: Industrial property includes but is not limited to patents for inventions, trademarks, industrial designs and geographical indications. Copyright covers literary works like novels, poems and plays, films, music and artistic works, for example drawings, paintings, photographs, sculptures, web site pages and architectural design. Rights related to copyright include those of performing artists in their performances, producers of phonograms in their recordings, and broadcasters in their radio and television programs.

For many companies, such as those in the pharmaceutical business, IP is much more valuable than any physical asset. IP theft costs U.S. companies as much as $600 billion a year according to the Theft of Intellectual Property Commission.

What are the 4 types of intellectual property?

The four legally defined categories of intellectual property for which theft can be prosecuted are:

Patents grant the legal right to exclude anyone else from manufacturing or marketing your unique tangible things. They can also be registered in foreign countries to help keep international competitors from finding out what your company is doing. Once you hold a patent, others can apply to license your product. Patents can last for 20 years.

Trademarks are names, phrases, sounds or symbols used in association with services or products. A trademark often connects a brand with a level of quality on which companies build a reputation. Trademark protection lasts for 10 years after registration and can be renewed in perpetuity.

Copyright protects written or artistic expressions fixed in a tangible medium — novels, poems, songs or movies. A copyright protects the expression of an idea, but not the idea itself. The owner of a copyrighted work has the right to reproduce it, to make derivative works from it (such as a movie based on a book), or to sell, perform or display the work to the public. You don't need to register your material to hold a copyright, but registration is a prerequisite if you decide to sue for copyright infringement. A copyright lasts for the life of the author plus another 50 years.

Trade secrets can be a formula, pattern, device or compilation of data that grants the user an advantage over competitors is a trade secret. They are covered by state, rather than federal, law. To protect the secret, a business must prove that it adds value to the company — that it is, in fact, a secret — and that appropriate measures have been taken within the company to safeguard the secret, such as restricting knowledge to a select handful of executives.

IP can can simply be an idea as well. If the head of your R&D department has a eureka moment during his morning shower and then applies his new idea at work, that's intellectual property too.

IP theft examples

If your IP is stolen by ne'er-do-wells, catching them is hard, prosecuting them is harder, and getting the stolen information back — putting the proverbial cat back in its bag — is usually impossible. In this area, a little paranoia is quite helpful, because people really are out to get you. That’s why it’s important for the CSO, CISO, and chief risk officer (CRO) to be involved in protecting IP.

CSO contributor Christopher Burgess offers these real-life examples:

In February, 2018, Apple discovered that iOS source code had been posted to GitHub. The code in question would allow potential attackers to ""manipulate the iOS to make iPhone jailbreaks easier and potentially discover vulnerabilities more easily. An Apple intern was found to be responsible for the leak, having shared the code with ""five friends who were active in iPhone jailbreak groups.""

In October, 2017, an Apple engineer was fired for a video posted by his daughter of the then prototype iPhone X. ""The engineer’s daughter posted a video of her experience accompanying dad to the office, and it included the embargoed phone,"" Burgess writes.

In May 2017, Xu Jiaqiang, a Chinese national, pleaded guilty to stealing source code from IBM, where he had worked from 2010-2014. ""In late-2015, Xu had a face-to-face meeting with undercover law enforcement officers. At the meeting, Xu noted the code was his former employer’ s(IBM) code. Xu also confirmed to his interlocutors how he had purloined the code prior to his May 2014 employment separation and had made modification so as to obscure the point of origin, IBM.""

In February, 2019, Xiaorong You was ""indicted for her actions involved in the theft of trade secrets.... She is accused of trade secret theft and economic espionage after allegedly stealing bisphenol-A-free (BPA-free) technologies owned by several companies, including her former employers Coca-Cola and Eastman Chemical Company. The value placed on the development of the stolen technologies is $119.6 million.""

10 steps to protect intellectual property

The steps below are the minimum you should to top keep your IP safe.

1. Know what intellectual property you've got

If all employees understand what needs to be protected, they can better understand how to protect it, and from whom to protect it. To do that, CSOs must communicate on an ongoing basis with the executives who oversee intellectual capital. Meet with the CEO, COO and representatives from HR, marketing, sales, legal services, production and R&D at least once a quarter. Corporate leadership must work in concert to adequately protect IP.

2. Know where your intellectual property is

If you focus your efforts on your core IT systems to secure IP, you will overlook other areas where it might be stored or processed. These include:

Printers, copiers, scanners and fax machines: Your input/output devices all store the documents they process, and they are typically networked and connected to remote management systems. Proper policies and procedures need to be in place to purge these documents and protect against unauthorized access.

Cloud applications and file-sharing services: These might be company-managed or shadow IT. You need to know what your employees are using so you can restrict unauthorized cloud services and ensure that company-sanctioned services are properly configured and secured.

Employees’ personal devices: An employee might email a document home, typically for benign reasons. Educate your employees on the proper handling of IP and have monitoring systems in place to track where your IP is being sent.

Third-party systems: IP is often shared with business partners, suppliers, or customers. Make sure your contracts with those parties define how those third parties must secure your IP and have controls in place to ensure those terms are followed.

3. Prioritize your intellectual property

CSOs who have been protecting IP for years recommend doing a risk and cost-benefit analysis. Make a map of your company's assets and determine what information, if lost, would hurt your company the most. Then consider which of those assets are most at risk of being stolen. Putting those two factors together should help you figure out where to best spend your protective efforts (and money).

4. Label valuable intellectual property

If information is confidential to your company, put a banner or label on it that says so. If your company data is proprietary, put a note to that effect on every log-in screen. This seems trivial, but if you wind up in court trying to prove someone took information they weren't authorized to take, your argument won't stand up if you can't demonstrate that you made it clear that the information was protected.

5. Secure your intellectual property both physically and digitally

Physical and digital protection is a must. Lock the rooms where sensitive data is stored, whether it's the server farm or the musty paper archive room. Keep track of who has the keys. Use passwords and limit employee access to important databases.

6. Educate employees about intellectual property

Awareness training can be effective for plugging and preventing IP leaks, but only if it's targeted to the information that a specific group of employees needs to guard. When you talk in specific terms about something that engineers or scientists have invested a lot of time in, they're very attentive. As is often the case, humans are often the weakest link in the defensive chain. That's why an IP protection effort that counts on firewalls and copyrights, but doesn't also focus on employee awareness and training, is doomed to fail.

In most cases, IP leaves an organization by accident or through negligence. Make sure your employees are aware of how they might unintentially expose IP. According to a February 2019 study by Egress Software Technologies, the most common technologies through which sensitive data like IP are accidentally breached are:

External email like a Gmail or Yahoo account (51 percent)

Corporate email (46 percent)

File sharing via FTP (40 percent)

Collaboration tools like Slack or Dropbox (38 percent)

SMS or instant messaging apps like Whatsapp (35 percent)

With email, IP might be sent to the wrong person because:

The sender used a wrong address--for example, Outlook auto-inserted an email address for someone other than the intended recipient

The recipient forwarded the email

An attachment contained hidden content, such as in an Excel tab

Data was forwarded to a personal email account

7. Know your tools to protect intellectual property

A growing variety of software tools are available for tracking documents and other IP stores. Data loss prevention (DLP) tools are now a core component of many security suites. They not only locate sensitive documents, but also keep track of how they are being used and by whom.

Encrypting IP in some cases will also reduce risk of loss. The Egress survey data shows that only 21 percent of companies require encryption when sharing sensitive data externally, and only 36 percent require it internally.

8. Take a big picture view

If someone is scanning the internal network and your intrusion detection system goes off, somebody from IT typically calls the employee who's doing the scanning and tells him to stop. The employee offers a plausible explanation, and that's the end of it. Later, the night watchman sees an employee carrying out protected documents, and his explanation is ""Oops...I didn't realize that got into my briefcase."" Over time, the human resources group, the audit group, the individual's colleagues, and others all notice isolated incidents, but nobody puts them together and realizes that all these breaches were perpetrated by the same person. This is why communication gaps among infosecurity and corporate security groups can be so harmful. IP protection requires connections and communication between all the corporate functions. The legal department has to play a role in IP protection. So does human resources, IT, R&D, engineering, graphic design and so on.

9. Apply a counter-intelligence mindset

If you were spying on your own company, how would you do it?

These are AvosLocker, Hive Ransomware, HelloKitty, and LockBit 2.0.

Emerging ransomware threat groups

“With major ransomware groups such as REvil and Darkside lying low or rebranding to evade law enforcement heat and media attention, new groups will emerge to replace the ones that are no longer actively targeting victims,” stated the security firm’s latest report Ransomware Groups to Watch: Emerging Threats. Within the research, Doel Santos, threat intelligence analyst, and Ruchna Nigam, principal threat researcher, detailed behaviors of the four ransomware groups.

AvosLocker

First observed in July 2021, AvosLocker operates within the ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model and is controlled by avos, which advertises its services on dark web discussion forum Dread. Its ransom note includes information and an ID used to identify victims, instructing those infected to visit the AvosLocker Tor site for recovery and data restoration. According to the research, ransom requests have been between $50,000 and $75,000 in Monero, with infections identified at seven organizations around the globe.

Hive Ransomware

Beginning operations in June 2021, Hive Ransomware has been detected targeting healthcare organizations and other businesses ill-equipped to defend against cyberattacks, according to the report. The group published its first victim on its leak site Hive Leaks, before going on to post details of another 28 victims. “When this ransomware is executed, it drops two batch scripts,” wrote the researchers. “The first script, hive.bat, tries to delete itself, and the second script is in charge of deleting the shadow copies of the system (shadow.bat). Hive ransomware adds the [randomized characters].hive extension to the encrypted files and drops a ransom note titled HOW_TO_DECRYPT.txt containing instructions and guidelines to prevent data loss.”

Victims are directed via the ransom note to a chat function with the attackers to discuss decryption. The researchers are unable to specify the exact delivery method of the ransomware but suggest traditional means such as credential brute-forcing or spear-phishing could be at play.

HelloKitty: Linux Edition

The HelloKitty family surfaced in 2020, primarily targeting Windows systems. Its name comes from its use of HelloKittyMutex. In 2021, Palo Alto detected a Linux (ELF) sample with the name funny_linux.elf containing a ransom note with verbiage that directly matched ransom notes seen in later samples of HelloKitty for Windows. Further samples were discovered, and in March they began targeting ESXi, a target of choice for recent Linux ransomware variants.

“Oddly enough, the preferred mode of communication shared by attackers in the ransom notes across the different samples is a mix between Tor URLs and victim-specific Protonmail email addresses,” the researchers wrote. “This could indicate different campaigns or even entirely different threat actors making use of the same malware codebase.” Ransom demands as high as $10 million in Monero have been detected, though attackers are also willing to accept Bitcoin payments. The ransomware encrypts files using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).

LockBit 2.0

Previously known as ABCD ransomware, LockBit 2.0 is another group that operates as an RaaS. Although in operation since 2019, Palo Alto has discovered recent evolution in the group’s methods, with the actors claiming their current variant is the fastest encryption software in operation. Since June, the group has compromised 52 global organizations. “All the posts by the threat actors on their leak site include a countdown until confidential information is released to the public, which creates additional pressure on the victim,” researchers write. Upon execution, LockBit 2.0 begins file encryption and appends the .lockbit extension. When encryption is complete, a ransom note titled Restore-My-Files.txt notifies victims of the compromise and offers advice on steps for decryption."

The Senate confirmed Easterly in July, with swearing taking place on August 09, 2021. It should come as no surprise to CISOs to see Easterly dig in and immediately leverage the newly minted Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC), which was authorized in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2021.

The JCDC’s mission, according to CISA, is to “leverage new authorities” and “bring together public and private sector entities to unify deliberate and crisis action planning while coordinating the integrated education of these plans. The plans will promote national resilience by coordinating actions to identify, protect against, detect, and respond to malicious cyber activity targeting US critical infrastructure and national interests.”

Who is Jen Easterly?

Easterly is no stranger to being first when it comes to innovation and being able to see a bit over the horizon when it compared to her peers. She served 20-years in the Army where she is credited with standing up the first “cyber battalion.” The National Security Agency (NSA) saw her present from 2011 to 2013, which happened to be immediately after the standing up of the unified US Cyber Command in 2010. She is credited with fleshing out that nascent organization into full operational mode. Following this, she went to Morgan Stanley in 2017 where she stood up the company’s “Firm Resilience and the Fusion Resilience Center,” or simply Cyber Fusion Center (CFC).

Easterly, spoke remotely at the recent Black Hat conference, where she emphasized the need to build the nation’s cybersecurity workforce. Not news to CISOs with empty requisitions, she commented on how there were over 500,000 jobs awaiting personnel in the United States.

Security operations center, CFC and JCDC

CISOs have seen the evolution in cybersecurity to include the attempt to corral information, detect intrusions, and respond accordingly. Nirvana occurs when intrusions are handled automatically without the need for personnel intervention. Over time many companies have stood up security operations centers (SOCs) where their physical and virtual worlds meld. Others have attempted to create CFC-like groups where disparate data sets are melded and decisions are made.

The new JCDC, according to Easterly, will initially focus on ransomware and the cloud. Companies that have been identified as participating include Cisco, Microsoft, Google, Lumen, Amazon Web Services, FireEye, Crowdstrike, Palo Alto Networks, AT&T and Verizon.

“Security operations centers are one dimensional,” says John Burger, CISO at ReliaQuest. “Sometimes the response will include a threat intel function. Seldom [will it] have a holistic view of the business from a business continuity perspective.”

Meanwhile, Anuj Goel, CEO of Cyware (and one who participated in the development of CITI’s CFC), notes how “the fundamental difference between a CFC and SOC is how each unit approaches and operationalizes security.” Goel highlighted how SOCs connect the silos at one location, compared to the CFC, which “coalesces all these siloed units into a single, collaborative, and integrated force to streamline end-to-end threat detection, management and 360-degree response.” When established, Goel says, the security silos are eliminated.

Burger provided his insight from the CISO’s seat that creating a CFC is not for the faint of heart, and his observation will not surprise anyone involved in cybersecurity with its many silos. “The single largest barrier is the organization’s will to bring disparate parts of the “cyber domain” (IT, business continuity, SOC, and threat intel) into one center.”

Enterprise CISOs, when compared to their SMB brethren, enjoy a bounty of resources. There is no denying the CISOs at SMBs are often financially disadvantaged as well as being hamstrung when it comes to engagement in the ever growing “public private partnership.” This is where Easterly’s efforts at CISA will have an immediate impact, as she has already begun the outreach to the resourced constrained, with invitations to engage CISA, as well as providing a plethora of tools and assessments available for the taking.

Some SMBs may be thinking of building their own fusion centers, and the CEO of Minerva Labs, comes down strongly against that idea. Instead, he proffers, “The right direction for SMBs is to find tools that won’t demand them to hire a big security teams, tools which can be used by any IT employee.” He explained, “most cybersecurity tools are complex and for them to work properly and protect with full power, a large professional team is needed.”

Is Easterly’s JCDC for everyone?

Goel adroitly points out how Easterly’s experience is going to “open doors for CISA to force multiple security capabilities while enhancing collaboration with industry sectors through strategic and technical information sharing.” On the larger, national scale, “Easterly’s efforts will foster collective defense across organizations within the US and synchronize their strengths against rapidly evolving and shape shifting threat actors.”

Whether JCDC will also be able to assist entities not involved in national infrastructure is a question waiting to be answered. The answer is no if you don’t ask, so ask. CISOs interested in participating in the JCDC should email CISA."

Introduced in January 2021 by the Wi-Fi Alliance, Wi-Fi 6E allows for an increased frequency band of 6 GHz, providing up to 1,200 MHz of additional spectrum compared to Wi-Fi 6.

In April 2020, the FCC voted to open 6 GHz for unlicensed use, meaning that electrical consumer products such as phones, tablets, laptops, and routers could benefit from the enhanced Wi-Fi performance. Commenting last year, FCC chairman Ajit Pai said, “I expect that 6 GHz unlicensed devices will become a part of consumers’ everyday lives. And I predict the rules we adopt today will play a major role in the growth of the internet of things, connecting appliances, machines, meters, wearables, smart televisions, and other consumer electronics, as well as industrial sensors for manufacturing.”

“This change in how Wi-Fi operates is likely to alter the way people use Wi-Fi networks, with 6E allowing more devices to connect at greater speeds,” says Paul Holland, principal research analyst at the Information Security Forum (ISF). “Until now, there were limitations on some of the heavier network related devices like virtual reality, but with more connectivity available, a whole raft of new devices will enter the market as manufacturers look to make money from this newer capability.”

As Wi-Fi usage increases, CISOs will need to be aware of its benefits and challenges. These are the most important for now:

Wi-Fi 6E is more secure than previous versions

Speaking to CSO, David Coleman, director of wireless networking at Extreme Networks, adds that, in several ways, Wi-Fi 6E will be more secure than previous generations of Wi-Fi because the Wi-Fi Alliance is mandating WPA3 security certification for all Wi-Fi 6E devices, with no backward compatibility support for WPA2 security. “In effect, this means that Management Frame Protection (MFP) is required in the 6 GHz band and Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) replaces pre-shared key (PSK) security. This is an important improvement, as SAE is resistant to the offline dictionary attacks that can plague PSK authentication.”

The Wi-Fi Alliance is also requiring Enhanced Open certification support and will mandate support for Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE) in 6 GHz. “This means there will be no more ‘open’ networks and encryption will always be used to protect user data,” says Coleman.

Wi-Fi 6E risks: Rush to market might introduce vulnerabilities

As with any emerging technology, the adoption of Wi-Fi 6E has the potential to create new cybersecurity risks. “In the rush to develop 6E-enabled devices, manufacturers may neglect security for speed to market, introducing vulnerabilities if no security mechanisms are included or if there is no path to update the new 6E-enabled devices,” warns Holland. “Organizations need to be more aware of the potential risks posed by the release of Wi-Fi 6E and the implementation of devices that will come as part of this upgrade of networking infrastructure. The fact that organizations have been caught out in the past by Wi-Fi, 4G and 5G shows lessons are not being learned, and the level of awareness is still not where it should be.”

CISOs must therefore recognize, communicate, and mitigate the organizational cybersecurity risks posed by Wi-Fi 6E. Which should be of most concern to security leaders? Below are three security threats that should be of primary focus.

1. New 6 GHz rogue devices

The buzz phrase in Wi-Fi security has always been the rogue access point (AP), an open and unsecured gateway that inadvertently offers access to a company’s wired infrastructure, says Coleman. “A wireless rogue device can be used for data theft, data destruction, loss of services, and other attacks. Typically, hackers aren’t responsible for installing rogue APs. More often than not, it’s well-meaning employees who don’t realize the consequences of their actions.”

As new consumer-grade Wi-Fi 6E APs and routers continue to be made available in the marketplace, they are prime rogue device candidates because today’s wireless intrusion prevention system (WIPS) solutions are primarily focused on monitoring for and protecting against 802.11-based wireless attacks and threats on the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands — not in the 6 GHz band. “Vendors that offer APs with tri-frequency sensor capabilities in their APs will take the lead in 6 GHz rogue detection,” Coleman adds.

2. Wi-Fi 6E lacks backward compatibility with WPA2

Existing Wi-Fi clients will never be able to connect to 6 GHz, and so enterprises will need to implement different levels of security for different frequency bands, something that is likely to create significant administrative challenges. “WPA3 will be used in 6 GHz, but WPA2 will remain prevalent in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands for a very long time,” Coleman says.

Issues with backward capability are likely to cause security headaches for CISOs, Holland agrees. “The new technology will lead to manufacturers leaving older Wi-Fi devices out of their update process when vulnerabilities are discovered, meaning they will no longer receive patches. This will leave some internet of things devices to be forgotten by manufacturers and maybe even by the organizations themselves, creating the risk of having unmonitored and unpatched devices on corporate networks.”

3. OWE Wi-Fi 6E vulnerabilities

“Many organizations will choose to use OWE in 6 GHz even though the Enhanced Open certification meets only half the requirements for comprehensive Wi-Fi security,” Coleman says. “OWE provides encryption and data privacy, but there is no authentication whatsoever, creating the potential for hijacking and impersonation attacks. WPA3-Personal or WPA3-Enterprise are better options because authentication is mandated.”

Addressing Wi-Fi 6E cybersecurity threats

Organizations will need to engage with their security teams with regard to the advent and incorporation of Wi-Fi 6E. Coleman and Holland cite five important steps enterprises must take to mitigate the risks:

Upgrade WIPS solutions to full 6 GHz monitoring capabilities, even if you are not yet deploying Wi-Fi 6E. Look for WIPS solution sensors that have 6 GHz radios and offer tri-frequency band scanning from a single radio. Avoid OWE in the 6 GHz band and use WPA3-Personal (SAE) or WPA3-Enterprise (802.1X). Ensure that security leaders and IT teams are educated about this issue and take it seriously. “Don’t get caught flat-footed,” says Coleman. Use network segmentation to ensure that 6E-enabled routers and devices are safely implemented across an enterprise. “This may mean only purchasing devices with a recognized support contract (for patches and problems), as well as putting new devices through all the due diligence processes that are part of the procurement lifecycle,” says Holland. “This will ensure that any manufacturer or vendor is linked to an organization’s supply chain management.” Consider a zero-trust strategy, as it can assist in protecting each device via protect surfaces and help by supporting strong authorization/authentication protocols, limiting lateral movement following a breach of a 6E device.

Wi-Fi 6E is the most exciting thing to happen to Wi-Fi in nearly 20 years, says Coleman. “Whilst people may well be overlooking the practical realities and challenges of actually implementing this technology, 2021 is likely going to be a breakthrough year for Wi-Fi 6E in the enterprise, emerging as a major focus for IT teams over the next several months.”"

The exposed details differed across different types of customers, so the level of risk users are exposed to varies.

Victims of the T-Mobile or any other breach where personal data is stolen should be aware of follow-on attacks and take steps to mitigate them. These include SMS/text-based phishing, SIM swapping and unauthorized number porting.

The T-Mobile data breach

On Sunday, Motherboard reported that hackers were advertising for sale a data dump that they claimed contained the Social Security numbers (SSNs), phone numbers, names, physical addresses, International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) numbers, and driver's license information for 100 million T-Mobile subscribers. On Monday, T-Mobile confirmed that it investigated the claims and found evidence of unauthorized access to some of the company's data, but did not specify what type of data was impacted.



On Wednesday, the mobile operator revealed that the compromised data included full names, dates of birth, SSNs and driver’s license/ID information for 7.8 million current T-Mobile postpaid customers as well as over 40 million former or prospective customers who had applied for credit with T-Mobile. No phone numbers, account numbers, PINs, passwords, or financial information were exposed for these users. However, names, phone numbers, and account PINs were exposed for 850,000 active T-Mobile prepaid customers.

The account PIN is important security information that T-Mobile's customer support representatives use to authenticate account holders during customer care calls. It is mandatory for all accounts and is between six and 15 digits long. If an attacker is in possession of a user's personal information, phone number, and PIN, they can call customer support and potentially impersonate the account owner to make modifications on their accounts enabling various attacks.

SMS phishing and victim profiles

One common threat after any data breach is phishing, a form of social engineering where attackers use the stolen private information to construct believable messages impersonating companies or brands. In the past, attackers have used data leaked from a breach to impersonate the same company where the breach occurred, sometimes even using the breach itself to get users to perform actions that exposed additional information or led to malware infections.

In the case of mobile communications, such phishing attacks could be launched over SMS messages, impersonating the mobile operator. At first glance, in the case of the 48 million current, former, and prospective T-Mobile customers whose personal details were exposed, attackers can't target them directly with SMS phishing because their phone numbers were not exposed. However, many leaked data sets on the internet from numerous other breaches include phone numbers, and attackers could potentially cross reference the data from the T-Mobile breach to previously leaked data to discover the phone numbers for at least a subset of the affected individuals, since people don't change their phone numbers often.

This also works in reverse. For the 850,000 prepaid customers who had their names, phone numbers, and PINs exposed, attackers could use data from past breaches to complete profiles that were missing phone numbers, for example. The more breaches occur, the easier it is for attackers to build complete victim profiles and launch attacks that are increasingly hard to detect by both companies and users.

SIM swapping and mobile number porting

Another type of attack that is specific to phone users is SIM swapping. This is when an attacker manages to convince a mobile operator to associate a victim's phone number with a SIM card under their control to receive all their phone calls and text messages. Switching a phone number to a different SIM card is a legitimate service that mobile operators use when a subscriber's device is lost or stolen or when their existing SIM card stops working or needs to be upgraded or changed for technical reasons.

SIM swapping attacks have gained popularity with attackers in recent years because it allows them to bypass security systems that rely on one-time use codes sent over SMS or communicated via a phone call by automated systems. Phone-based verification is often the default option offered by online services for two-factor authentication, account identity verification and recovery, bank transaction authorizations and more. Moreover, even when users enable a mobile app authenticator to generate one-time codes for an online service, SMS or voice still remain enabled as a failover option and can be abused unless explicitly disabled.

SIM swapping is generally a targeted attack, where the attacker has built a profile of the victim and has identified a valuable asset worth compromising and the attack vectors required to do so. In 2019, the FBI's San Francisco office issued an alert that criminals were using SIM swapping attacks to target users who held considerable cryptocurrency assets. They described the attack chain as follows:

Identify the victim: Identify a victim likely to own a large amount of digital currency, particularly cryptocurrency. Identify the victim’s mobile telephone number and the mobile phone carrier.

Swap the SIM card: Socially engineer a customer service representative from the mobile phone company to port the victim’s phone number to a SIM card and phone in the control of the attackers.

Password resets: Initiate password resets on the victim’s email, cloud storage, and social media accounts (password resets are usually accomplished by text messages to the victim’s telephone number).

Access accounts: Gain access to the victim’s accounts and identify digital currency keys, wallets, and accounts that may be stored in them. Defeat any SMS-based or mobile application-based two-factor authentication on any accounts with control of the victim’s phone number.

Steal currency: Transfer the digital currency out of the victim’s account into accounts controlled by the attackers.





Last year, the US Congress sent a letter to the FTC urging the agency to force wireless carriers to take action to protect users against SIM swapping attacks.

A variation of this attack is mobile number porting where attackers impersonating the victim convince their carrier to port their number to a different SIM card on a different network. This is a legitimate service that allows mobile subscribers to retain the same phone number when they switch to a different service provider. In February, T-Mobile sent some of its customers a data breach notification letter informing them that their accounts were compromised and attackers ported their numbers to a different carrier without authorization.

T-Mobile account PINs are explicitly meant to prevent SIM swapping or number porting as they serve as an additional method to verify the account holder is the person making the request. Following this new breach, the company reset the PINs of the 850,000 prepaid customers who had their numbers and phone numbers exposed and encouraged the other 48 million current, former, and prospective postpaid customers to change their PINs, even though so far there's no evidence their PINs were not compromised. That doesn't exclude the possibility that attackers could use the data leaked in this breach to craft credible phishing attacks to ask victims for their new PINs or to direct users to spoofed pages that ask for their PIN.

Mitigating risks from breached data

T-Mobile is offering all impacted customers a free two-year subscription for McAfee's ID Theft Protection Service, which includes credit monitoring, full-service identity restoration, identity insurance, dark web monitoring, and more. Business and postpaid customers can also enable T-Mobile's Account Takeover Protection service for free and all T-Mobile users can use the company's Scam Shield app that enables caller ID and automatically blocks calls flagged as scams.

More generally, all mobile subscribers should check with their carriers what options they have to secure their accounts against SIM swapping or number porting and they should enable that additional verification. Using text messages or phone calls for two-factor authentication should be disabled where possible in favor of two-factor authentication via a mobile app or a dedicated hardware token, especially for high-value accounts. Email accounts are high-value accounts because they are used to confirm password reset requests for most other online accounts.



Finally, be wary of email or text messages that ask for sensitive information such as passwords, PINs, access tokens, or that direct you to websites that ask for such information; especially if those messages follow a highly publicized data breach. If you receive a suspicious message from a service you have an account with, access the company's website by typing it directly in the browser or call their customer support department to confirm the legitimacy of the message before acting on it."

Some studies report that up to 88% of organizations are using Kubernetes for their container orchestration needs and 74% of that occurring in production environments. That said, security remains a critical concern with as many as 94% of organizations reporting at least one security incident in their Kubernetes environments in the last 12 months.

As organizations continue to adopt Kubernetes, it is crucial that they follow industry best practices and guidance to ensure they are using Kubernetes securely. One great resource is the Kubernetes Hardening Guidance recently published by the US National Security Agency (NSA) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).

Other valuable security guides and books for Kubernetes security include the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Kubernetes Benchmark, Department of Defense (DoD) Kubernetes Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG), and the Kubernetes Security book by Liz Rice and Michael Hausenblas of Aqua Security.

The Kubernetes Security Hardening Guidance identifies three common sources for Kubernetes security risk: supply chain risks, malicious threat actors, and insider threats. The guidance also breaks down its coverage across key areas such as threat modeling, Kubernetes pod security, network separation and hardening, authentication and authorization, log auditing, and upgrading and application security best practices.

The guidance starts by explaining the core architectural components of Kubernetes. This includes the overarching cluster and its core components such as the control plane, nodes, and pods, which reside on nodes. Understanding these core components is key to understanding how Kubernetes functions, how the components interact, and ultimately how to secure them.

NSA/CISA Basic Kubernetes components

Control plane

One of the most important aspects of Kubernetes clusters is the control plane. It makes global decisions about the cluster and can have devastating effect if it is compromised by malice or simply incompetence. This investigation uncovered 2,284 etcd servers that malicious actors could access through the internet.

The components that make up the control plane include the controller management, cloud controller manager, Kubernetes API server, etcd, and the scheduler. Each operates on unique ports within the cluster and has specific functions. Your ability to exert control over these components can vary, especially if you are using a managed Kubernetes service from a cloud service provider (CSP) such as AWS’s Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). While this may seem like a drawback, managing the Kubernetes control plane is a complex task. Depending on your workforce skill level, using a managed Kubernetes offering and focus on your applications is probably the most secure option. A managed Kubernetes offering like EKS handles activities related to the control plane and underlying infrastructure like upgrades, fixes, and security patches.

NSA/CISA Kubernetes architecture

Pod security

Kubernetes pods are the smallest deployable unit in the Kubernetes ecosystem. This is where organizations’ containerized applications reside, and pods are a primary entry point for malicious actors. For this reason, it is critical to follow best practices. This includes not allowing containers to run as root, using immutable containers with writable directories, and ensuring you are deploying secure container images, free of known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, poor access control, protecting pod service account tokens, and more. You can also take advantage of emerging guidance on container hardening best practices.

Network separation and hardening

Your security efforts shouldn’t stop at the pods. Networking within the cluster is also key to ensuring that malicious activities can’t occur, and if they do, they can be isolated to mitigate their impact. In addition to securing the control plane, key recommendations include using network policies and firewalls to both separate and isolate resources and encrypting traffic in motion and protecting sensitive data such as secrets at rest.

One core way of doing this is taking advantage of the Kubernetes namespace native functionality. While three namespaces are built-in by default, you can create additional namespaces for your applications. Not only does the namespace construct provide isolation, but it can help use resource policies to limit storage and compute resources at the namespace level as well. This can prevent resource exhaustion, either by accident or maliciously, which can have cascading effect on the entire cluster and all its supported applications.

While namespaces can help provide resource isolation, leveraging network policies can control the flow of traffic between the various components including pods, namespaces and external IP addresses.

Cloud infrastructure

While much of the guidance focuses on securing Kubernetes clusters and their core components, it points out that you must still protect the cloud infrastructure itself. Kubernetes is most often deployed on virtual machines running in cloud environments. If you fail to secure those machines, all the security rigor employed on the underlying clusters and applications will be irrelevant if a malicious actor can just take down, take over, or compromise the infrastructure your clusters and applications reside on.

Administrators should adhere to industry best practices from the CSPs to harden the infrastructure and leverage either cloud-native or third-party tooling to both secure and monitor the hosting infrastructure for malicious activities. A great place to start is security guidance from the leading CSPs such as AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform.

Authentication and authorization

Much like other aspects of IT, authentication and authorization are a fundamental part of securing access to Kubernetes. This is further complicated by the fact that user authentication is not a built-in feature of Kubernetes.

In Kubernetes there are two types of users: service accounts and normal user accounts. Kubernetes uses bearer tokens to support authentication and these tokens are often stored in well-known locations, which can be targeted from outside the cluster if not secured.

Administrators can implement role-based access control (RBAC) to assign roles to individuals and grant access accordingly. This must be enabled in the cluster and then the administrator can use the native permission types of roles and clusterroles. Administrators can leverage roles to set permissions for specific namespaces and clusterroles to set permissions for all cluster resources.

Log auditing

Despite the best of efforts to prevent and mitigate all security incidents and concerns, incidents will happen. When they do, logging is absolutely critical to determining what happened and how. The guidance emphasizes using log auditing for both verifying that things are operating as intended and being able to investigate when they aren’t. The guidance lays out specific activities that should be logged, which includes API requests, performance metrics, deployments, network traffic, and scaling. All these metrics provide key insights into how clusters are operating and potentially malicious activities, should they occur.

The guidance points out that auditing capabilities aren’t enabled by default. It also emphasizes the need to use next-gen SIEM platforms that support Kubernetes environments due to their complex and dynamic nature.

Upgrading and application security practices

The guidance points out that while hardening clusters and the various components is important, security doesn’t stop there. Security practices and activities also apply to applications running on the servers and hosted in the Kubernetes environments. This is where industry guidance such as CIS benchmarks and others come into play. While taking the measures laid out in this guide can help, as well as using managed Kubernetes service offerings from CSPs, you ultimately still own and are responsible for the applications running in the clusters. You must secure them appropriately.

Securing a Kubernetes cluster, its various components, residing applications, and the underlying cloud infrastructure is an arduous and complex task. That said, industry guidance like the NSA/CISA Kubernetes Hardening Guide provide a great starting point. Misconfigurations pose the greatest threat to cloud and Kubernetes environments, and teams must address them accordingly to ensure secure adoption and use."

Putting security of one’s customers behind one’s public face is wrong, and frankly, it stinks to high heaven.

Let’s dig in.

The BadAlloc vulnerability

In late April 2021, Microsoft researchers revealed the BadAlloc bug was affecting a wide range of IoT devices and vendors. Microsoft characterized the vulnerability as potentially allowing an attacker to perform a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. Many vendors took the advisory on board and by May 2021 were mitigating and messaging how the vulnerability may impact customers and the pathway to remediation.

Though BlackBerry’s OS was installed across a multitude of industries, including critical infrastructure, the US federal government, automotive, industrial controls and medical devices, the company seemed to think this gale wind wasn’t going to affect its sails. They remained silent.

US pressured BlackBerry to go public

BlackBerry rolled out its advisory on August 17, 2021. That advisory stepped right through the fact that the vulnerability discovered in April was being revealed in August. It did, however, note that if those using the QNX do not mitigate the threat with the provided patches that there “are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.”

It isn’t known how much pressure it took to get BlackBerry to reveal that QNX was affected, as suspected in April, by the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Multiple media outlets report that CISA was unrelenting in its efforts to have BlackBerry publicly reveal the vulnerability and not simply inform their partners who were imbedding the OS into products.

BlackBerry argued, according to Politico, that it had no visibility into how its customers were using its product. Indeed, the company insisted it keeps “lists of our customers and have actively communicated to those customers regarding this issue. Software patching communications occur directly to our customers.”

Following the release of the BlackBerry advisory, CISA issued its own advisory and duly highlighted the need to mitigate across government agencies and the nation’s critical infrastructure companies, to include those involved with the US Coast Guard and the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission; both entities put out their own advisories to affected entities within their domain.

The unpatched vulnerability was not only affecting industrial controls and automotive applications, it was also affecting a plethora of medical devices. The Food and Drug Administration issued its own advisory, again, once BlackBerry had owned up, and emphasized how the vulnerability may “introduce risk for certain medical devices and drug manufacturing equipment.” What was clear from the FDA advisory is the scope of the exposure caused by BlackBerry’s QNX vulnerability is unknown. The FDA has urged those impacted to contact the FDA at once and identify product equipment and systems that have been deemed vulnerable.

Both CISA and the FDA were quick to note there have not been any confirmed adverse events associated with the BlackBerry vulnerability.

Did BlackBerry dodge a bullet?

Regardless of whether BlackBerry dodged the bullet of having the vulnerability exploited while they sorted their public-facing verbiage, the bottom line is the Canadian company took its time and needed prodding by the US government to do the right thing. They now face a shellacking in the court of public opinion. What remains to be seen is if the FDA will weigh in with fines and other administrative actions given the vulnerability left unpatched or mitigated devices within the healthcare sector.

It is unknown if input will be coming from other federal agencies/departments given BlackBerry’s recent announcement that it was integrating its technologies into vehicles with California’s “Car IQ” where the vehicle will essentially function as an electronic wallet.

The take-away for all CISOs is obvious: Manufacturers and consumers both want to know that when a vulnerability is discovered by the companies they trust, that trusted entity will let them know about vulnerabilities in a timely and forthright manner. Once trust is broken it is hard to repair and the adage “one aw-shucks wipes out a hundred atta-boys” applies."

As part of the research for this report, we always ask cybersecurity professionals several questions about the global cybersecurity skills shortage. Is it real? Are things improving or getting worse? Is your organization impacted and, if so, how?

Here are some key points this year's survey revealed:

Most organizations are impacted. This year, 57% of respondents said that their organizations have been impacted by the global cybersecurity skills shortage. Among those who reported being impacted, 62% said that the skills shortage has increased the workload on existing staff; 38% said that new security jobs remain open for weeks or months; and 38% said that the skills shortage has led to employee burnout and employee attrition. This situation is difficult and unsustainable.

This year, 57% of respondents said that their organizations have been impacted by the global cybersecurity skills shortage. Among those who reported being impacted, 62% said that the skills shortage has increased the workload on existing staff; 38% said that new security jobs remain open for weeks or months; and 38% said that the skills shortage has led to employee burnout and employee attrition. This situation is difficult and unsustainable. The skills shortage is not improving. Forty-four percent of survey respondents believe the cybersecurity skills shortage (and its impact) have gotten worse over the past few years, while 51% say it’s about the same today as it was over the past few years. Sadly, only 5% believe the situation has gotten better.

Forty-four percent of survey respondents believe the cybersecurity skills shortage (and its impact) have gotten worse over the past few years, while 51% say it’s about the same today as it was over the past few years. Sadly, only 5% believe the situation has gotten better. Recruiting and hiring cybersecurity staff remains challenging. Seventy-six percent of security professionals say it is either extremely (18%) or somewhat difficult (58%) to recruit cybersecurity professionals.

Seventy-six percent of security professionals say it is either extremely (18%) or somewhat difficult (58%) to recruit cybersecurity professionals. There is an acute shortage of cloud security and other skills. Cloud computing security is cited by nearly four in ten respondents (39%) as the area with the most acute skills shortage, followed by application security and/or security analysis and investigations (30%). Given this data, it’s safe to assume that organizations will face stiff competition when recruiting cybersecurity specialists in these areas.

Given this data, it’s safe to assume that organizations will face stiff competition when recruiting cybersecurity specialists in these areas. Organizations are not doing enough to bridge the cybersecurity skills gap. Twenty-seven percent of survey respondents believe their organization could be doing somewhat more to address the skills shortage while nearly one-third (32%) say their organizations could be doing much more. This seems to indicate that status quo solutions are not working.

Twenty-seven percent of survey respondents believe their organization could be doing somewhat more to address the skills shortage while nearly one-third (32%) say their organizations could be doing much more. This seems to indicate that status quo solutions are not working. The cybersecurity skills shortage exposes organizational issues. Survey respondents were asked to identify factors contributing to the skills shortage’s impact at their organizations. Alarmingly, 29% said that their HR department doesn’t really understand cybersecurity skills, so it probably excludes qualified candidates, while 25% claim that cybersecurity job postings tend to be unrealistic, demanding too much experience, too many certifications, etc. Clearly, CISOs and HR executives must get on the same page here.

Cybersecurity professionals have some helpful recommendations. When asked what more their organizations could do to address the skills shortage, cybersecurity professionals suggested actions like increasing the commitment to cybersecurity training, boosting compensation, providing additional perks, and creating or improving a cybersecurity internship program. All worthwhile considerations.

Five years of ESG/ISSA data reinforces the fact that the cybersecurity skills shortage remains a nagging problem with no easy answers. ESG/ISSA believe that organizations should strongly consider the survey respondents’ suggestions presented in the report. Meanwhile, CISOs should assume that the skills shortage may affect every aspect of their cybersecurity programs.

Actions to take now

While most organizations are impacted by the cybersecurity skills shortage (70% percent of the cybersecurity professionals we surveyed say that they are solicited by recruiters at least once per month), those that value cybersecurity, align cybersecurity with the business, and create a strong cybersecurity culture are in the best position to attract and retain talent.

Remember, too, that the skills shortage includes a shortage of personnel AND advanced skills. Therefore, organizations can address aspects of the skills shortage by increasing their commitment to continuing cybersecurity education.

CCSP is a cloud-focused security certification for experienced security pros offered by the International Information System Security Certification Consortium, or (ISC)2. CCSP stands for Certified Cloud Security Professional, and it's one of a suite of certs offered by (ISC)2, a nonprofit focused on training and certifying cybersecurity professionals.

While (ISC)2 has been offering certifications since the 1980s, CCSP is a relatively new cert on the scene: it was rolled out at the RSA Conference in 2015 and has grown more popular since as more and more enterprises aim to securely move storage, infrastructure, and applications to the cloud. (ISC)2 says that CCSP certification demonstrates that ""you have the advanced technical skills and knowledge to design, manage and secure data, applications and infrastructure in the cloud using best practices, policies, and procedures.""

Following are some answers to frequently asked questions about this security certification built for the cloud.

Who should get CCSP certified?

As Daniel Carter, author of CCSP Cloud Security Professional All-in-One Exam Guide, said an interview, ""The best candidates are more experienced IT architect and security types, including engineers. For people whose companies are moving into the cloud, it's important. It's also a good way to expand your marketability to employers. Since the cloud is so new, the CCSP gives employers a way to see that potential employees have gone through the rigor of the exam.""

A CCSP certification signals both that you have demonstrated domain knowledge and that you possess relevant experience. We'll dig into what a CCSP cert can mean for your career later in this article; but first, let's look how you can go about getting certified.

What is covered on the CCSP exam?

Let's start with the part of CCSP certification most people are most focused on: the exam. The CCSP contains questions that draw from what (ISC)2 calls the common body of knowledge, or CBK, for cloud security professionals — a ""peer-developed compendium of what a competent professional in their respective field must know, including the skills, techniques, and practices that are routinely employed."" The CBK is in turn broken down into domains, or topic areas. The different CCSP domains and the portion of the exam you can expect each to take up are as follows:

Cloud concepts, architecture, and design: 17%

Cloud data security: 19%

Cloud platform and infrastructure security:17%

Cloud application security: 17%

Cloud security operations: 17%

Legal, risk and, compliance: 13%

You'll take the exam on a computer terminal at your local Pearson VUE test center. You have three hours to take the test, which consists of 100 to 150 questions; the length varies because it's an ""adaptive"" test, meaning that if you answer enough questions within a domain correctly to show competence for that domain, your computer terminal will stop asking you those types of questions. (There's a lively discussion thread in the (ISC)2 community forums where test-takers talk about how many questions they saw when they took it.)

The questions are multiple-choice, but you may encounter ""scenario-based"" questions, where you have to answer several multiple-choice questions about an example scenario. In addition, 25 questions on each test are ""pre-test"" questions: they're included for research purposes as (ISC)2 assesses them for possible inclusion on future tests. They don't count towards your score, but they also aren't marked, so you won't know which ones they are.

The CCSP exam is available in English and Japanese. You can find more details on (ISC)2's website.

How much does the CCSP exam cost?

The CCSP exam costs $599 in the United States, with comparable costs in local currencies in the EU and the UK.

This is a not insignificant outlay of cash—and it's important to keep in mind that this isn't the only cost involved in CCSP certification. There are more requirements (and associated payments) as well.

What are the CCSP requirements?

Passing the CCSP exam is only one step of the CCSP certification process. Because this isn't a certification for those at the beginning of their careers, candidates must also demonstrate industry career experience.

In a nutshell, to get CCSP certified, you must have:

At least five years of paid work experience in IT;

At least three years of which must be in information security;

And at least one year of which must be in one or more of the six CCSP CBK domains we listed above.

(ISC)2's website has more details, including ways alternate experience like part-time or unpaid work can be counted towards these requirements. If you already have the Cloud Security Alliance's Certificate of Cloud Security Knowledge, (ISC)2 considers that equivalent to a year of professional experience. (ISC)2's CISSP security certification has its own extensive professional experience requirements, and if you already have that cert, that experience also qualifies you for CCSP. (CSO has more info on CISSP here.)

In addition, (ISC)2 requires an endorsement from another (ISC)2-certified professional that attests to your work experience, although you can make arrangement with (ISC)2 itself to provide an endorser if you don't know anyone who can serve the role.

One last note on this topic: even if you don't have all the experience needed to achieve certification yet, you can still take the CCSP exam. If you pass, you can receive Associate of (ISC)2 status, with access to (ISC)2 training resources as you work towards your ultimate certification goal, which you have six years to achieve.

How much does CCSP certification cost?

In addition to the cost of the exam, candidates aiming to be fully certified must pay (ISC)2 $125 in Annual Maintenance Fees. (For Associates, these fees are only $50 a year.) Because these fees are for membership in the organization, they are the same no matter how many (ISC)2 certs you're maintaining. You'll also need to fulfill continuing education requirements, which may have associated costs as well.

CCSP vs CISSP: Is CCSP harder than CISSP?

As we noted above, (ISC)2 has another certification for upper-level security pros with a fair amount of industry experience: Certified Information Systems Security Professional, or CISSP. The biggest difference between them is that the CISSP exam draws from a much broader and more general pool of security knowledge: it's meant to show that you can design, implement, and manage a cybersecurity program at the enterprise level. CCSP, by contrast, is entirely cloud focused. It covers less ground than CISSP—and indeed, the CISSP exam is twice as long as CCSP’s. But CCSP is also more in-depth on cloud topics.

A thread on the (ISC)2 community forums offers some interesting insight into how different people who have taken, or are considering taking, both exams approach the question of which is harder—and in what order you should take the two exams.

What CCSP training is available?

If you dive into that thread, you'll also see discussion of how much time and effort those forum users put into studying for the exam — and it some cases it was many, many hours. Even if you think you're cloud security savvy, you're still going to want study resources to help you prepare. (ISC)2 provides its own official material for this purpose, including a study guide and a collection of practice tests.

Of course, there are third-party books available as well. We've mentioned Daniel Carter above; his book is considered the gold standard. You also might want to check out Gwen Bettwy's CCSP Cloud Guardians.

If you want to go beyond books, there are a variety of more fully featured and interactive training courses available to you. (ISC)2 offers a self-paced training course that comes bundled with the exam itself, which can save you a bit of money. The Infosec Institute offers a CCSP boot camp that comes with an exam pass guarantee (basically, if you fail the exam after taking their training course, they'll pay for you to take it again).

As is the case with most certs, there are plenty more training courses out there. Here's a great list of open online CCSP courses, ranked by enrolled students and reviews, to give you a sense of the most popular.

What salary can I get with CCSP certification?

We're going to end with the question that's probably been lurking in your mind as you made your way through this article: Can a CCSP certification help you make more money?

This is much easier to ask than to answer. Obviously, it's in the best interest of (ISC)2 to tell you that you a CCSP will boost your earning power. The org's website references a couple of salary surveys that show that CCSP holders make good money—more than $115,000 in North America, and on par with that elsewhere.

Of course, it's very difficult to tell whether this is a matter of correlation or causation. After all, in order to achieve CCSP certification, you need to have five or more years of industry experience under your belt, and that alone will boost your value in the job market. You should be wary of anyone who tries to guarantee you that a certification will provide a specific salary boost. That said, in an in-demand domain like cloud security, a certification can only make you stand out more—and CCSP and (ISC)2 are well respected in the industry."

If you are like 80% of respondents to the Trend Micro’s biannual Cyber Risk Index (CRI) report, you expect to experience a data breach that compromises customer data in the next 12 months.

The report surveyed more than 3,600 businesses of all sizes and industries across North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America for their thoughts on cyber risk. Despite an increased focus on security due to high-profile ransomware and other attacks in the past year, respondents reported a rise in risk due to inadequate security processes like backing up key assets.

Why security risk is rising

Organizations are overwhelmed as they pivot from traditional to distributed networks. Pandemic-driven work-from-home growth is potentially how businesses will be run going forward. That distributed network means that it’s harder for IT staff to know what assets are under their control and what security controls should be in place. With the line blurring between corporate and personal assets, organizations are overwhelmed with the pace of change.

Cloud deployments can bring their own complications as they are often misconfigured or leave credentials behind for attackers to find in such locations as GitHub. The cloud also has brought more platforms for attackers to go after. While Windows used to be the major target, now attackers are pivoting to attacking Linux and IoT devices.

Where security risk is rising

The Trend Micro CRI report identified the following areas of having elevated risk worldwide, meaning they scored below 5 on a scale of -10 to 10, where 10 is the lowest level of risk.

Ability of enabling security technologies to protect data assets and IT infrastructure: 4.05

IT security leader (CISO) has sufficient authority and resources to achieve a strong security posture: 4.09

The organization is involved in threat sharing with other companies and government: 4.37

IT security function supports security in the DevOps environment: 4.40

IT security function has the ability to know the physical location of business-critical data assets and applications: 4.45

North American respondents had a different list with lower ratings:

IT security function is able to prevent most cyberattacks: 2.55

IT security function is able to contain most cyberattacks: 2.80

The organization is involved in threat sharing with other companies and government: 3.16

Ability of enabling security technologies to protect data assets and IT infrastructure: 3.21

IT security function is able to detect zero-day attacks: 3.32

The reports’ top threat risks include man-in-the-middle attacks, ransomware attacks, phishing and social engineering, fileless attacks and botnets. Again, firms are concerned that their firms can prevent or detect most cyberattacks, let alone zero-day attacks.

Data types most at risk worldwide, according to the report, are business communication (email), financial information, analytics (data models), consumer data, and company confidential information. The top security risks in infrastructure are organizational misalignment and complexity, cloud computing infrastructure and providers, negligent insiders, shortage of qualified personnel, and malicious insiders.

Mitigating security risk

Firms need to spend more time and resources protecting key data repositories. Too often they are easy to target and identify as they have patterns that can be scanned for. Credit card numbers have a distinctive pattern when they are stored in databases, thus you must ensure that they are properly encrypted in transit, in storage, and at rest.

Keeping up with patching processes is important but difficult for most businesses. The concern is just as much about defending against targeted zero days as well as day-to-day patching processes.

Often firms are unaware of what is attacking them and must defend not knowing what their true risks are, but they lack the ability to share information about threats. Companies should consider joining an Information Sharing and Analysis Center (ISAC) dedicated to their industry. It’s a great way to get early warning of threats and advice for mitigating them.

The typical network generates vast and complex log data. If you don’t plan log archives ahead of time, you will lose information you need to properly perform investigations and understand how the attackers got into your network and what they accessed while they were in the network.

Pay attention to cloud and IoT risks. Too often cloud services are not set up with appropriate permission settings to facilitate ease of deployment. Review the flows for application permissions in cloud services to ensure they are set to where the administrator of the firm must approve new applications deployed in the network. Place appropriate focus on both security technological solutions as well as hiring appropriate staff to assist in sound security technologies.

Most important, the Trend Micro CRI survey showcases the need to focus on risk management and prioritizing the threats. Once you have that assessment (and presumably buy-in from company leadership), it will be easier to align security mandates across the network and take on other initiatives such as minimizing complexity in your network."

Long after a ransomware attack fades into gloomy history, your organization could face another potentially devastating financial threat: lawyers filing action lawsuits on behalf of clients who may have lost confidential personal or business information to the attackers.

Data breach legal actions aren't going away, as bad actors continue to exploit weaknesses in corporate IT systems and gain access to personal data, says David Balser, an attorney and leader of King & Spalding’s trial and global disputes practice. ""As cases evolve, plaintiffs are advancing novel theories of causation and damages, even when no harm to consumers has occurred,"" he notes.

Ted Kobus, practice chair for digital assets and digital management at law firm BakerHostetler, believes that the ransomware lawsuit landscape is rapidly changing. ""Historically, we have seen consumers filing these lawsuits,"" he says. ""However, due to the increase in the number of supply chain attacks, we may see downstream companies attempting to create a class seeking indemnification for business interruption, incident response costs, and other damages.""

Fortunately, a ransomware attack doesn't have to expose an enterprise to potential lawsuits. It's up to the CISO to minimize the risk of ransomware attacks and, if one occurs, to immediately take the steps necessary to limit the damage.

Here are seven actions CISOs can take to protect their enterprise against ransomware-related legal actions.

1. Assess the risk

The likelihood of a lawsuit is primarily dependent upon the type of ransomware attack, as well as what information was stolen—if any. ""For instance, if you operate a consumer-facing website that's frozen due to ransomware, but no consumer information is extracted, the likelihood of a class action is minimal,"" says Jeff Dennis, a partner at law firm Newmeyer & Dillion. However, if the ransomware attack led to the extraction of mass amounts of consumer data, then the chances of facing a class action lawsuit may increase dramatically. ""Additionally, if you are a company that stores or manages data for a number of other companies and you are ransomed, you may face a class action lawsuit brought by those companies if they cannot access their data for a significant period of time,"" he notes.

A proper risk assessment will tell you where your weak points are in network access permissions, network monitoring and visibility, backup systems, and staff training. Include your connected business partners in the assessment process, too, to ensure that they have deployed strong security technologies and practices.

2. Adopt ransomware prevention best practices

The best way for an organization to protect itself against a financially devastating lawsuit is to take reasonable steps to avoid becoming a ransomware attack victim. Such steps include conducting cybersecurity education and awareness activities, creating an incident response plan, controlling and ranking user access privileges, monitoring for potential malware exposures, and deploying effective network monitoring and visibility tools.

3. Build a recovery plan

Since a ransomware attack can occur anytime, anyplace, and to any type of enterprise, it's important to be fully prepared. A disaster recovery plan will help an organization victimized by ransomware to get back on its feet as quickly as possible with minimal impact on customers and business partners.

Many organizations follow the ""3-2-1"" backup and recovery rule. This strategy requires creating three file backups, with two backups placed on different types of storage media and another copy located offsite (but not in the cloud, which might also be affected by an attack). The recovery plan should also address backup frequency (generally at least daily) and regular backup testing.

4. Practice good security hygiene

If a CISO follows generally accepted security best practices, it's likely that the organization will be recognized for its good faith efforts and less likely to be viewed as negligent.

A first step toward ensuring that critical files are ransomware resistant is requiring two-factor authentication for access, notes Ron Gula, president of venture capital and private equity firm Gula Tech Adventures. Other steps to take include encrypting data, setting backup drive files to read-only once the write process has been completed, and unmounting the drive the moment a backup is completed.

Additional common-sense security measures include keeping system and application software up to date, using segmented network technology, and educating management and staff on generally recommended security practices. ""Ransomware testing must be continuous as well,"" Gula warns. ""Just like wearing masks and getting vaccines for COVID, protecting your files and data from ransomware is the new normal.""

In essence, prevention is the best protection. An enterprise that's committed to following best security practices and updating its strategy and tactics as the ransomware battlefield evolves, should be able to successfully defend itself against aggrieved parties today and for years to come. ""The law regarding customers suing for data breaches is far from clear, with some federal courts making ... plaintiffs prove significant harm while others have said that the threat of future harm, such as through identity theft, is sufficient to provide legal standing,"" says Steven J.J. Weisman, an attorney and college professor who teaches courses on white collar crime at Bentley University. ""Regardless, it can be expected that companies will in the future be held to greater standards in regard to protecting their data.""

5. Encourage top-down management support

Senior management commitment is critical to a cybersecurity compliance program’s success, says Braden Perry, a litigation, regulatory, and government investigations attorney at law firm Kennyhertz Perry. ""This commitment is shown when management ... provides the compliance department with the authority to implement, communicate, and improve compliance policies and procedures.""

Even the best security policies and practices will ultimately fail without the full support of enterprise leaders. It's crucial to have direct-line access to the CEO and the organization’s oversight committees, Perry says. ""The CISO should be part of senior management, with sufficient resources and staff to oversee and manage the compliance structure,"" he advises. Forward-thinking enterprises view and treat their compliance departments as an asset, not a cost, which can be the key to creating buy-in from the top down.

6. Support transparency

Once a ransomware attack has been confirmed, the CISO should immediately begin working with management colleagues on ways to minimize the event's impact on external parties. Kobus suggests focusing response efforts on clearly and honestly communicating with all affected individuals or business partners. ""In the more than 15 years I have been working on these types of matters, there has been one constant—clear and transparent communication is the best way to assure affected parties that you conducted a responsible and appropriate investigation ... and you have taken steps to ensure that this type of incident does not happen again.""

Enterprises that are transparent with their customers, actively engage with them, and generally try to do the right thing, stand the best chance of either avoiding or winning a ransomware lawsuit, Dennis says. Being open about the attack's scope and impact, as well as detailing the steps that were taken to protect confidential customer data, can go a long way toward defusing the anger that many class action attorneys relish, he notes.

7. Consider insurance coverage

Depending on the policy acquired, general liability insurance may be able to protect an enterprise against some or all lawsuit costs. ""The insurance company will ordinarily cover the investigation, litigation—including attorney fees—and judgments/settlement,"" Perry says. Be sure to check the policy carefully, however, including any recent updates or amendments. Given the recent rise in ransomware attacks, most insurance carriers are beginning to reevaluate their coverage options.

There's also an important downside to relying on general liability insurance as a financial shield. ""There are disadvantages, as your litigation strategy is put into the insurance company's hands and they control who they hire, and the strategy/settlement negotiations,"" Perry explains. He also warns that insurance policies generally won’t cover punitive damages or intentional acts.

Perry also cautions against relying on errors and omissions (E&O) or professional liability insurance, since such policies are limited to service provided. ""This is questionable coverage for ransomware attacks, so an enterprise may be stuck with traditional liability coverage,"" he notes."

What is Amazon Sidewalk?

Amazon Sidewalk is a free service (currently only available in the US) that extends internet connection of low-power, long-range, low-data Amazon devices such as certain Echo and Ring models beyond a home network to a local, shared network. Operating in the 900 MHz LoRa spectrum, it uses a small amount of a user’s internet, shares it with nearby Amazon devices and creates a mesh network to keep devices connected to the internet when a home-based internet connection is down or has weak connection.

Amazon Sidewalk security risks

Amazon stated, “Preserving customer privacy and security is foundational to the design of Amazon products and services, and Amazon Sidewalk provides multiple layers of privacy and security to secure data travelling on the network and to keep customers safe and in control.” As such, it has implemented technologies such as data minimization, encryption, and trusted device identities to keep Amazon Sidewalk users secure.

However, according to Cato Network’s Q2/21 SASE Threat Research Report, potential security issues surrounding its use can undermine effective risk assessment. Etay Maor, cybersecurity researcher and director of security strategy at Cato Networks, tells CSO, “The threat Sidewalk poses from a security standpoint is the inherent lack of visibility IT has into the data stream. Sidewalk is too new to know what vulnerabilities might exist, and CISOs and their teams will find it hard to mitigate those risks because anything happening in the Sidewalk tunnel will be invisible to IT.”

When a CISO lacks visibility of what device types connect to the organization’s network, there is no way of knowing what risks they may introduce, he says. “Are they infected? Do they have current anti-malware software? What about the fact that it connects to neighbor’s networks? Those (and others) are all unknowns because the devices themselves are unknown.” Another potentially risky aspect of the Sidewalk service is the lack of data control, he adds. “Where does the data go? How do third-party developers patch and update the software?” The firm detected hundreds of thousands of Sidewalk flows with some enterprises having hundreds of such devices.

With regards to mitigating the risks posed to network security by consumer services and device spoofing linked to Houdini malware, Maor says CISOs need to be looking for threat symptoms found in the network layer. “C&C communications, for example, carry some telltale signs such as periodic communication with servers rarely visited by users in domains of poor reputation. By looking for the symptoms and not the explicit attack signature you’ll be able to detect Sidewalk threats. Context sharing between network and security products is key here.”"

Where is your information? Who has access to the information? Do you have control of your information in each country, or does the government also have access (and control) of your data?

Oracle describes how “the exponential growth of data crossing borders and public cloud regions [has seen], more than 100 countries now have passed regulations.” There is no one-size-fits-all set of rules and therein lays the conundrum for CISOs, especially those whose customer base or digital infrastructure crosses political boundaries.

In a paper published on August 3, Professor Susan Ariel Aaronson of George Washington University commented how under the guise of digital sovereignty, “governments are seeking to regulate commercial use of personal data without enacting clear rules governing public sector use of data.”

In a 2020 “ideas paper,” the EU described digital sovereignty as “Europe's ability to act independently in the digital world and should be understood in terms of both protective mechanisms and offensive tools to foster digital innovation (including in cooperation with non-EU companies).”

The EU’s GDPR has effectively forced a sea change, not only for EU-centric companies, as Kim Chan, CEO of DocPro notes, “the GDPR being an EU regulation, organizations all around the world have scrambled to comply with it. This is because the GDPR is applicable not only within the EU but also applies to entities that offer goods and services and collect and process the data of EU customers.”

The interest in securing citizens’ data is universal. The African Union is working to catch up with the development of a unified common data system. The goal is to “regulate the ever-increasing production and use of data across the continent, whilst creating a safe and trustworthy digital environment that supports the development of a sustainable and inclusive Arica digital economy and society.”

Stephen Boyce, senior advisor to the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) reflected on the IFES experience, given their non-profit has offices in over 20 countries, characterizing complying with the data sovereignty laws of each country to be “challenging.” He continued how the need to account for the more understood laws, GDPR, and the one-offs as they pop up, means ""our team has to go to the drawing board to think through how it will impact our operations.”

The looming question that all CISOs and managed security service providers (MSSP) must be able to answer is, “Where is the data?”

Avoiding data sovereignty violations

Those companies who are putting their data into the cloud must realize that not all providers are created equal and one must do their due diligence to ensure they avoid storing data in places with data sovereignty laws. Daniela Sawyer of FindPeopleFast, speaking from firsthand experience, found that “verifying that data exists only at allowed locations is difficult. It requires the cloud customer to trust that their cloud provider is completely honest and open about where their servers are hosted and adhere strictly to service level agreements (SLAs).”

It isn’t just the smaller companies having issues. In May 2021, the EU’s European Data Protection Supervisor opened a probe into how entities within the EU were using both AWS and Azure to answer the question: Are they adequately protecting the privacy of their users?

Expect data sovereignty to increase OPEX

Operating expenses are being impacted by data sovereignty. Attila Tomaschek of ProPrivacy commented, “Additional ongoing expenditures include continuous staff training on cybersecurity best practices, investment in new technologies and network monitoring tools, and bringing on additional personnel such as a data protection officer, compliance officer, or other staff dedicated to securing business data and complying with data sovereignty laws.”

A similar view is shared by Jesse David Thé, CEO of Tauria, who shared how his entity navigates through GDPR: “We need to show a specific data trail of how we obtained someone's contact information. They have a right to be forgotten from our system and we must have explicit permission to send them marketing emails. This data exists within our walled garden, and we can't share it with any of our partners for example. Neither can a partner share client contact information with us unless the client gives permission.”

Thé noted how the need to comply drove their OPEX up and was instrumental in the decision to hire “a CIO to help us ensure our GDPR compliance.” He continued how small companies will need to budget for this.

Infosec must evolve

Anderson Lunsford, CEO of BreachRx noted how breach notification requirements are changing with insurance companies requiring near real-time notification of breaches or compromises. The insured that fails to do so puts coverage of its claims at risk. Lunsford also observed how companies may have incident response plans put together by information security professionals on paper, yet far too many never practice the scenarios outlined, nor have they incorporated the requirements of the various privacy laws.

Lunsford notes one salient aspect of breach response, especially when considering penalties imposed upon companies: “The companies that are penalized the most aren’t necessarily those with the biggest breaches, but those that don't handle the response work well. Regulators have been increasingly vocal about their views in this regard. It is well-accepted in the security and privacy industries that incidents will happen to all organizations (it's not if, but when). Regulators and customers expect companies to be prepared for these inevitable situations and respond timely and appropriately.”

Penalties come, and some come at you hard. Law firm Morrison & Foerster (MoFo) in a recent Privacy Minute newsletter shared how businesses in and outside of Russia have received queries asking the companies to confirm that they store the personal data of Russian citizens in Russia. Google’s Russian experience is worthy of approbation. In late July “a court in Moscow fined Google 3 million rubles ($40,750) for the US technology giant's refusal to localize the personal data of its users in Russia.”

In India, credit card companies are apparently finding India’s data privacy laws difficult to navigate. MasterCard was the most recent entity to be barred from accepting new customers in India due to allegedly being noncompliant. MasterCard was preceded by American Express and Diners Club with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) booting all three indefinitely from issuing new credit or debit cards within the Indian domestic market. RBI alleges they violated data storage rules.

“The disparate and myriad data sovereignty laws around the globe necessitate clearer views into data flows, but to date, there is no one, easy way for large enterprises to achieve full visibility and monitoring,” says Katie Teitler, vice president of research and advisory at TAG Cyber. “Newer tools are coming on the market to help, but at least for the foreseeable future, a lot of time and money will be spent on compliance.”

Suffice it to say, the view over the horizon sees a good deal of heavy lifting for CISOs and their teams."

Despite that, organizations are focusing almost exclusively on infrastructure security. They must also consider a SaaS governance plan that implements security measures to reduce risk associated with their SaaS usage. That plan includes a combination of compliance frameworks, documentation/due diligence and technical measures for ongoing monitoring and risk reduction.

Much of the security discussion around cloud adoption focuses on infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)/platform-as-a-service (PaaS) providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, and for good reason. Organizations have experienced tremendous growth of IaaS adoption and seen countless security breach headlines associated with IaaS misconfigurations.

However, the risks that poorly implemented and secured SaaS present have been neglected. Gartner predicts SaaS will remain the largest public cloud market segment, and that prediction came prior to COVID-19, which facilitated an unprecedented SaaS boom. Furthermore, organizations typically tend to use only a few IaaS providers, such as the big three cloud service providers (CSPs), while consuming many more SaaS offerings. A 2020 study from Blissfully found that large enterprises use as many as 288 different SaaS apps, with small- to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) using more than 100.

While your organization may have started to mature its IaaS security, the same likely isn’t true for the more expansive and diverse SaaS landscape. This reality also makes shadow IT usage of SaaS providers much more prevalent than IaaS providers, due to the large array of SaaS offerings in the marketplace and the ease with which you can consume them, often with as little as a credit card.

A study conducted by Zylo found that organizations are adding, on average, ten SaaS offerings to the enterprise per month and IT only directly manages 25% of them. That is a lot of unmanaged SaaS risk. Despite this exponential growth in SaaS usage, a study by AppOmni found that only 32% of respondents employ any type of tooling to ensure data security in SaaS.

Despite this widespread SaaS adoption, why do organizations continue to focus almost exclusively on IaaS security concerns? Some of that is due to misunderstanding the shared responsibility model and assuming in a SaaS environment the CSP is responsible for everything. The other factor is that security teams are simply struggling to keep pace with their organizations’ cloud usage and with the fallout from widespread high-profile IaaS data breaches.

Major IaaS providers offer clear certification and learning paths, ensuring professionals can learn how to secure their platforms and attest to that. SaaS doesn’t offer that same scenario. As security professionals, we must continue to evolve, and SaaS security is ripe for maturing to the point where it can begin to mitigate this enormous amount of unaddressed risk.

An approach to SaaS risk

Implementing security for SaaS usage should be data driven. This means looking at the internal data that the SaaS offering has access to, the level of access within your enterprise, and the potential security and regulatory ramifications if that data was to be inadvertently exposed or maliciously compromised. This is especially true with today’s geographically dispersed workforce where individuals access data from everywhere, often from their own devices.

The first step in the process is capturing what SaaS your organization is using. Depending on the organization's maturity and technical architecture, this could be a manual inventory management process or require technical tools such as cloud access security brokers (CASBs), which can help identify shadow SaaS use.

When organizations start to put security rigor around their SaaS usage, they tend to take two approaches. One focuses on security frameworks such as SOC2, PCI and FedRAMP as well as documentation review. The other focuses on technical assessment, hardening and ongoing monitoring. The ideal approach involves a bit of both as discussed below.

Frameworks, documentation and reports

When organizations begin to vet SaaS offerings for their organization (ideally prior to purchasing and implementing them), it tends to involve popular frameworks such as SOC2, CSA CCM and STAR/CAIQ, or FedRAMP.

SOC2 has increasingly become a popular option for SaaS providers, since it helps to validate a company’s internal controls related to security, availability, confidentiality, integrity and privacy. Another popular option is CSA’s Consensus Assessment Initiative Questionnaire (CAIQ), which documents what controls exist in XaaS offerings and is tied to CSA’s Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM), a cloud specific security control framework. On the public sector side, the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is widely used as a way to authorize cloud service offerings (CSOs) for government consumption and uses NIST 800-53 security controls.

Organizations often do and should ask for these certifications becaue they often include a third-party assessment organization (3PAO) process where a third party verifies that the SaaS organization and its offering meet a specific level of security rigor. This gives your organization a level of assurance that the SaaS offering isn’t fully insecure and that the organization is doing basic security activity around its own infrastructure and how they handle and store customer data.

The choice of which frameworks to use largely depends on the industry the organization is operating in as well as the maturity of the SaaS vendor. Given these frameworks can be time and resource intensive, newer SaaS vendors usually don’t pursue the certifications until they have matured a bit and their customers have asked for them. There is also the reality that due to the exponential number of SaaS offerings in the market, some of the major compliance programs simply haven’t kept pace, such as FedRAMP.

In cases where the SaaS vendor doesn’t have a certification or audit, or even if they do, and the data you will use them for them is highly sensitive, you may wish to dig into their documentation and other criteria to vet their suitability. This could include results from internal or external pen tests (which often require an NDA) and discussions around architecture, authentication, encryption and much more. These additional activities help give your organization a level of assurance related to the risk of using a specific SaaS offering.

Technical SaaS coverage/capabilities

While frameworks are a great start in terms of vetting SaaS offerings, it is just a start. You should also consider technical controls, configurations and monitoring as part of your SaaS governance strategy. Each SaaS offering comes with myriad unique features, configurations and settings, most of which your staff will be unfamiliar with from a security perspective.

Enter SaaS security posture management (SSPM) tools, which monitor your SaaS application’s security posture. Some of the most popular SSPM tools are AppOmni and Obsidian. These vendors support some of the leading SaaS offerings such as Box, GitHub, Salesforce, and Slack.

They have crafted secure configurations, security scanning, best practices and recommendations for helping organizations harden their SaaS usage. Many of these offerings leverage industry resources where possible, such as CIS Benchmarks for SaaS offerings including Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace, which both can contain sensitive data and communications.

These hardening efforts can help protect your organization from prevalent security concerns such as account compromise, insecure configuration, compliance, and access management. They can also help with incident response. This is incredibly valuable, as your workforce likely doesn’t have the specific security insight and expertise needed for each of your SaaS applications. SSPM vendors constantly add more SaaS offerings to their coverage and depending on the size of your organization, you may be able to help shape their product roadmap to cover SaaS that is widely used in your organization.

In addition to technical security concerns, organizations must also be concerned with compliance in the SaaS paradigm. Remember that shared responsibility model? It still applies here.

Platforms such as AppOmni can help automatically enforce critical compliance controls related to widely applicable frameworks such as PCI, HIPAA, GDPR and NIST. It’s untenable for an organization to maintain continuous compliance with these frameworks across potentially hundreds of SaaS apps, and this is where technical solutions to augment those efforts can really shine."

Larva Labs, the creator of CryptoPunks, just signed with United Talent Agency (UTA) in a representation deal that will bring one of the earliest and most iconic NFT projects into the entertainment and branding worlds.

“I would say that it is one of the first opportunities for an IP that fully originated in crypto-world to enter a broader entertainment space, and they earned it,” head of UTA Digital Assets Lesley Silverman told The Hollywood Reporter. “They really have hit the zeitgeist in a tremendous way.”

The deal could see CryptoPunks popping up across film, TV, video games and other licensing areas. Larva Labs’ other art projects, Meebits and Autoglyphs, will also be represented by UTA moving forward. The terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.

As speculative investment in NFTs explodes, CryptoPunks remain one of the most recognizable — and valuable — pioneers in the space. Larva Labs launched 10,000 of the individual algorithmically-generated pixelated figures on the Ethereum blockchain back in 2017.

To the untrained eye, and arguably to the trained eye too, CryptoPunks are just little pixelated portraits of different characters, some wearing pirate hats, others in aviator glasses smoking pipes. But to the crypto world, punks are a social signifier, communicating early investment into NFTs, personal style and, importantly, wealth.

The value of CryptoPunks skyrocketed from zero (they were initially given away for free) and now even the least expensive collectible punks run for hundreds of thousands of dollars, with the most valuable selling for millions. In May, a bundle of nine CryptoPunks sold for just under $17 million in an auction run by Christie’s. And last week, even Visa got in the game, spending $150,000 on CryptoPunk #7610, a digital illustration sporting a mohawk and green face makeup.

Over the last 60 years, Visa has built a collection of historic commerce artifacts – from early paper credit cards to the zip-zap machine. Today, as we enter a new era of NFT-commerce, Visa welcomes CryptoPunk #7610 to our collection. https://t.co/XoPFfwxUiu — VisaNews (@VisaNews) August 23, 2021

It’s noteworthy that a traditional talent agency best known for representing A-list celebrities is getting into the NFT game, but it’s not the group’s first time getting its feet wet in the wild world of crypto. Earlier this month, UTA signed a company called Rally that runs a platform that helps creators issue branded social tokens that fans can spend on merch and exclusive content."

This sucks. I met my wife on LinkedIn Stories https://t.co/rMeA6gpYWI — Casey Newton (@CaseyNewton) August 31, 2021

LinkedIn introduced Stories in September, around the same time that Twitter rolled out Fleets to all users before doing away with the feature. This was part of a larger web and mobile redesign, which also added integrations with Zoom, BlueJeans and Teams to help professionals stay connected while working from home. But according to LinkedIn, these temporary posts didn’t quite work on the platform.

“In developing Stories, we assumed people wouldn’t want informal videos attached to their profile, and that ephemerality would reduce barriers that people feel about posting,” wrote LinkedIn’s Senior Director of Product Liz Li in a blog post today. “Turns out, you want to create lasting videos that tell your professional story in a more personal way and that showcase both your personality and expertise.”

Li also noted that users want “more creative tools to make engaging videos.” While Stories included stickers and prompts, users wanted more creative functionality.

If LinkedIn is successful in its plans to create a short-form video feature, it would join platforms like Snapchat and Instagram that have built their own TikTok-like feeds. Sure, most users probably don’t post the same content on LinkedIn and their personal social media accounts, but there actually are some prominent TikTokers sharing career advice, interview tips, and resume guidance, so LinkedIn’s pivot to video might not be as weird as it seems."

Cheeterz Club plans to start discussing fundraising with seed investors later this fall.","Can reading glasses actually be cool? A new eyewear company called Cheeterz Club thinks so. The startup is working to change the perception of reading glasses from being just cheap, disposable items you pick up from a rotating display rack at your local drug store to being something you’d actually be proud to wear. To do so, the company is designing its glasses with quality lenses and frames in range of styles, while still keeping the pricing affordable.

The startup — whose name is a reference to the slang term for glasses, “cheaters,” — was founded by Jennifer Farrelly, whose background includes work in advertising and sales at companies like Uber and Virool.

She said the idea to make a better set of readers came to her because she found herself frustrated by the current options on the market.

“It all started a few years ago. My friends were posting on social media these really depressing comments and posts like: ‘I’m old and turning into my parents, this is awful.’ And I [thought to myself] why does it have to be like that? I feel just as young today as I did ten years ago,” Farrelly explains. “Why are my friends and I feeling forced to feel old because of something that happens overnight?,” she says, of what felt like the sudden onset of middle age and the hardships it brings.

What’s worse, Farrelly says, is that when you finally make your way to the drugstore to pick out some reading glasses, all you’ll find are bad, plastic pairs that both look and feel cheap.

“That’s even more demoralizing,” she adds.

So Farrelly teamed up with a former Warby Parker and Pair Eyewear Head of Product, Lee Zaro, to design a new line of more fashion-forward eyewear.

Zaro, who’s based in the L.A. area, immediately saw the opportunity.

“Drugstore reading glasses are typically poor in quality, and can feel like they are designed with our parents in mind, leaving a huge unmet need for sophisticated eyewear options,” he said. “When Jennifer approached me to help design her first line of eyewear, I knew it was a brilliant idea.”

To differentiate itself from lower-end readers, Cheeterz Club glasses are made with 100% acetate and feature spring hinges and stainless steel. The lenses, meanwhile, offer more clarity than is often found in reading glasses.

Typically, ophthalmic plastic lens materials have an Abbe value — a measure of the degree at which light is dispersed or separated — between 30 and 58. The higher number offers better optical performance. Crown glass can have an Abbe value as high as 59, but polycarbonate readers (like those from Warby Parker, Farrelly notes) would have an Abbe value of 30. Cheeterz Club lenses, which are CR-39 lenses, are at at 58. This is a difference you can tell when trying the glasses on alongside your drugstore readers.

Cheeterz’ lenses also offer 100% UVA/UVB protection, and are oil and water repellent. They can optionally be bought in one of eight fashion tints, from pink to blue, or in two sun shades. Consumers can also opt to add Blue Light coating to help with screen-induced eye fatigue or they can choose Progressive lenses, which combine distance vision with a reading lens.

Tints are an extra $10, Blue Light protection is $25, and Progressive lenses are $40.99 — lower than market rates.

At launch, Cheeterz Club offers 14 different styles ranging from traditional to the more modern, starting at $28.99.

Farrelly says finding the right price was key, because unlike regular glasses, consumers often buy multiple pairs of readers to leave around the house or car, pack in purses and bags, and so on.

“If I break something that costs me a couple $100, I’d be really upset about it,” she says. “But at a drugstore price of under $30, I can have them in all sorts of colors and different tints.”

For Farrelly, making the startup a success goes beyond brining higher-quality reading glasses to market. It’s also about serving a demographic that often gets overlooked.

“Founders in their forties do not get representation, and it’s unfortunate. And there are also people in their forties and fifties that have disposable income and are looking for cute things. They’re spending so much money on facial creams and Botox,” she says, “but then you’re forced to put this really ugly pair of glasses on your face that make you feel bad about yourself.”

While Cheeterz Club today is selling direct to the consumer, the company is talking to eye doctors, boutiques and others who may eventually resell for them, as more of a B2B model. It’s also testing selling on Amazon with one pair of Blue Light glasses.

Cheeterz Club plans to start discussing fundraising with seed investors later this fall."

Rapid7 found the vulnerabilities in the Fortress S03, a home security system that relies on Wi-Fi to connect cameras, motion sensors, and sirens to the internet, allowing owners to remotely monitor their home anywhere with a mobile app. The security system also uses a radio-controlled key fob to let homeowners arm or disarm their house from outside their front door.

But the cybersecurity company said the vulnerabilities include an unauthenticated API and an unencrypted radio signal that can be easily intercepted.

Rapid7 revealed details of the two vulnerabilities on Tuesday after not hearing from Fortress in three months, the standard window of time that security researchers give to companies to fix bugs before details are made public. Rapid7 said its only acknowledgment of its email was when Fortress closed its support ticket a week later without commenting.

Fortress owner Michael Hofeditz opened but did not respond to several emails sent by TechCrunch with an email open tracker. An email from Bottone Riling, a Massachusetts law firm representing Fortress, called the claims “false, purposely misleading and defamatory,” but did not provide specifics that it claims are false, or if Fortress has mitigated the vulnerabilities.

Rapid7 said that Fortress’ unauthenticated API can be remotely queried over the internet without the server checking if the request is legitimate. The researchers said by knowing a homeowner’s email address, the server would return the device’s unique IMEI, which in turn could be used to remotely disarm the system.

The other flaw takes advantage of the unencrypted radio signals sent between the security system and the homeowner’s key fob. That allowed Rapid7 to capture and replay the signals for “arm” and “disarm” because the radio waves weren’t scrambled properly.

Vishwakarma said homeowners could add a plus-tagged email address with a long, unique string of letters and numbers in place of a password as a stand-in for a password. But there was little for homeowners to do for the radio signal bug until Fortress addresses it.

Fortress has not said if it has fixed or plans to fix the vulnerabilities. It’s not clear if Fortress is able to fix the vulnerabilities without replacing the hardware. It’s not known if Fortress builds the device itself or buys the hardware from another manufacturer.

The London startup has picked up $200 million, money that it will mainly be using to snap up more merchants. Existing brands in its portfolio cover categories like baby, pets, sports, personal health and home and garden categories — some of them, like PremiumCare dog chews, the Onco baby car mirror, gardening tool brand Davaon and wooden foot massager roller Theraflow, category best-sellers — and the plan is to continue building up all of these verticals.

Crayhill Capital Management, a fund based out of New York, is providing the funding, and Riccardo Bruni — who co-founded the company with twin brother Alessio and third brother Giancarlo — said that the bulk of it will be going towards making acquisitions, and is therefore coming in the form of debt.

Raising debt rather than equity at this point is pretty standard for companies like Heroes. Heroes itself is pretty young: it launched less than a year ago, in November 2020, with $65 million in funding, a round comprised of both equity and debt. Other investors in the startup include 360 Capital, Fuel Ventures and Upper 90.

Heroes is playing in what is rapidly becoming a very crowded field. Not only are there are tens of thousands of businesses leveraging Amazon’s extensive fulfillment network to sell goods on the e-commerce giant’s Marketplace; but some days it seems we are also rapidly approaching a state of nearly as many startups launching to consolidate these third-party sellers.

Many a roll-up play follows a similar playbook, which goes like this: Amazon provides the Marketplace to sell goods to consumers, and the infrastructure to fulfill those orders, by way of Fulfillment By Amazon and its Prime service. Meanwhile, the roll-up business — in this case Heroes — buys up a number of the stronger companies leveraging FBA and the Marketplace. Then, by consolidating them into a single tech platform that they have built, Heroes creates better economies of scale around better and more efficient supply chains, sharper machine learning and marketing and data analytics technology, and new growth strategies.

What is notable about Heroes, though — apart from the fact that it’s the first roll-up player to come out of the UK, and continues to be one of the bigger players in Europe — is that it doesn’t believe that the technology plays as important a role as having a solid relationship with the companies it’s targeting, key given that now the top Marketplace sellers are likely being feted by a number of companies as acquisition targets.

“The tech is very important,” said Alessio in an interview. “It helps us build robust processes that tie all the systems together across multiple brands and marketplaces. But what we have is very different from a SaaS business. We are not building an app, and tech is not the core of what we do. From the acquisitions side, we believe that human interactions ultimately win. We don’t think tech can replace a strong acquisition process.”

Heroes’ three founder-brothers (two of them, Riccardo and Alessio, pictured above) have worked across a number of investment, finance and operational roles (the CVs include Merrill Lynch, EQT Ventures, Perella Weinberg Partners, Lazada, Nomura and Liberty Global) and they say there have been strong signs so far of its strategy working: of the brands that it has acquired since launching in November, they claim business (sales) has grown five-fold.

Collectively, the roll-up startups are raising hundreds of millions of dollars to fuel these efforts. Other recent hopefuls that have announced funding this year include Suma Brands ($150 million); Elevate Brands ($250 million); Perch ($775 million); factory14 ($200 million); Thrasio (currently probably the biggest of them all in terms of reach and money raised and ambitions), Heyday, The Razor Group, Branded, SellerX, Berlin Brands Group (X2), Benitago, Latin America’s Valoreo and Rainforest and Una Brands out of Asia.

The picture that is emerging across many of these operations is that many of these companies, Heroes included, do not try to make their particular approaches particularly more distinctive than those of their competitors, simply because — with nearly 10 million third-party sellers today on Amazon globally — the opportunity is likely big enough for all of them, and more, not least because of current market dynamics.

“It’s no secret that we were inspired by Thrasio and others,” Riccardo said. “Combined with Covid-19, there has been a massive acceleration of e-commerce across the continent.” It was that, plus the realization that the three brothers had the right e-commerce, fundraising and investment skills between them, that made them see what was a “perfect storm” to tackle the opportunity, he continued. “So that is why we jumped into it.”

In the case of Heroes, while the majority of the funding will be used for acquisitions, it’s also planning to double headcount from its current 70 employees before the end of this year with a focus on operational experts to help run their acquired businesses."

Last time we checked in on the Boston-based company was in late-2019, when it raised $55 million. Now it’s back with a massive $200 million raise.

The Series F round brings Whoop’s total funding to nearly $405 million — a pretty massive investment for a company of its size. The round, led by SoftBank’s Vision Fund 2, puts the valuation at a jaw-dropping $3.6 billion valuation.

Additional investors include IVP, Cavu Venture Partners, Thursday Ventures, GP Bullhound, Accomplice, NextView Ventures and Animal Capital. They join a long list of former backers, including the National Football League Players Association, Jack Dorsey and a number of professional athletes.

The company’s targeting of athletes marks a strong contrast with leading consumer wearables like the Apple Watch and Fitbit. In fact, the company has a specific offering for sports teams, as well as solutions for businesses, healthcare and government/defense.

Whoop’s name made the rounds recently when Fitbit announced a “Daily Readiness Score” for the Charge 5, which many likened to the company’s more advanced analytics.

The company cites “rapid growth” in its membership offering over the past year as a motivation behind seeking additional funding. That was likely driven, in part, by the decision in 2019 to make the $500 wearable free, while focusing on a subscription service that starts at $18 a month for an 18-month membership (the shorter the membership, the more the monthly fee).

Whoop is eying international expansion beyond the U.S. and using the massive influx of cash on R&D for its hardware, software and analytics solutions. Money will also go toward expanding headcount, which is currently in excess of 500 (with nearly half of those employees having joined in the past year).

“We are thrilled to deepen our partnership with SoftBank as we grow internationally,” founder and CEO Will Ahmed said in a release. “While we have experienced amazing growth in the past year, the potential of our technology and the vast market for health monitoring remains largely untapped.”"

In addition to Dutch, German and French bank account numbers, existing and new users in Spain can now get a Spanish IBAN.

European IBANs are supposed to work across Europe. Your employer or internet provider can’t force you to get a local IBAN. And yet, that’s rarely the case. When you move to another European country, chances are the first thing you do is that you open a local bank account.

While European fintech companies have teamed up to create a lobbying effort called ‘Accept my IBAN’, some challenger banks, such as Bunq, are adding the ability to get local bank account numbers as an intermediary fix. Bunq users can also choose to associate IBANs from multiple European countries with their account. You have to pay a one-time fee of €9.99 every time you add a new local IBAN.

Bunq is also drawing inspiration from Revolut, Wise, Vivid Money and others as you’ll soon be able to receive, convert and hold other currencies. For instance, if you’re going to a non-Euro country for an internship, you will be able to receive your salary on your Bunq account. Bunq is starting with USD accounts with plans to add more currencies down the road.

Other new features include the ability to receive reminders the day before a direct debit occurs, a subscription view that lets you view current subscriptions and when they’re set to expire, an improved search feature and the ability to automatically accept direct debits and payment requests from your friends — make sure you set up a limit before enabling that feature.

Bunq recently announced plans to raise $228 million (€193 million) at a $1.9 billion valuation (€1.6 billion). The investment round hasn’t been approved by the Netherlands’ banking regulator just yet. Bunq is currently operating in 29 European markets and has more than €&billion in user deposits."

Tiger Global is in advanced stages of talks to lead a $100 million round in Apna, according to four sources familiar with the matter. The proposed terms value the startup at over $1 billion, the sources said.

The round hasn’t closed yet so terms of the deal may change, some of the sources cautioned.

If the round materializes, Apna will become the youngest Indian startup to attain the much coveted unicorn status. The startup, which launched its app in December 2019, was valued at $570 million in its Series B financing round in June this year. It will also be the third financing round Apna would have secured in a span of less than seven months.

Tiger Global, an existing investor in Apna, didn’t respond to a request for comment earlier this month. Apna founder and chief executive Nirmit Parikh, an Apple alum, declined to comment on Tuesday.

Indian cities are home to hundreds of millions of low-skilled workers who hail from villages in search of work. Many of them have lost their jobs amid the coronavirus pandemic that has slowed several economic activities in the world’s second-largest internet market.

Apna, whose name is inspired from a 2019 Bollywood song, is building a scalable networking infrastructure so that these workers can connect to the right employers and secure jobs. On its eponymous Android app, users also upskill themselves, review their interview skills, and become eligible for more jobs.

As of June this year, Apna had amassed over 10 million users and was facilitating more than 15 million job interviews each month. All jobs listed on the Apna platform are verified by the startup and free of cost for the candidates.

The startup has also partnered with some of India’s leading public and private organizations and is providing support to the Ministry of Minority Affairs of India, National Skill Development Corporation and UNICEF YuWaah to provide better skilling and job opportunities to candidates.

The investment talks further illustrate Tiger Global’s growing interest in India. The New York-headquartered firm has made several high-profile investments in India this year including in BharatPe, Gupshup, DealShare, Classplus, Urban Company, Coinswitch Kuber, and Groww.

More than two dozen Indian startups have become a unicorn this year, up from 11 last year, as several high-profile investors including Tiger Global, SoftBank, and Falcon Edge have increased the pace of their investments in the world’s second most populous nation.

Apna also counts Insight Partners, Lightspeed, and Sequoia Capital among its existing investors."

Instead of existing within a codebase behind a screen, the key components of your hardware product can be scattered around the world, subject to the volatility of the global economy.

I’ve spent most of my career establishing global supply chains, setting up manufacturing lines for 3D printers, electric bicycles and home fitness equipment on the ground in Mexico, Hungary, Taiwan and China. I’ve learned the hard way that Murphy’s law is a constant companion in the hardware business.

But after more than a decade of work on three different continents, there are a few lessons I’ve learned that will help you avoid unnecessary mistakes.

Expect cost fluctuations, especially in currency and shipping

Shipping physical products is quite different from “shipping” code — you have to pay a considerable amount of money to transport products around the world. Of course, shipping costs become a line item like any other as they get baked into the overall business plan. The issue is that those costs can change monthly — sometimes drastically.

At this time last year, a shipping container from China cost $3,300. Today, it’s almost $18,000 — a more than fivefold increase in 12 months. It’s safe to assume that most 2020 business plans did not account for such a cost increase for a key line item.

Shipping a buggy hardware product can be exponentially costlier than shipping buggy software. Recalls, angry customers, return shipping and other issues can become existential problems.

Similar issues also arise with currency exchange rates. Contract manufacturers often allow you to maintain cost agreements for any fluctuations below 5%, but the dollar has dropped much more than 5% against the yuan compared to a year ago, and hardware companies have been forced to renegotiate their manufacturing contracts.

As exchange rates become less favorable and shipping costs increase, you have two options: Operate with lower margins, or pass along the cost to the end customer. Neither choice is ideal, but both are better than going bankrupt.

The takeaway is that when you set up your business, you need to prepare for these possibilities. That means operating with enough margin to handle increased costs, or with the confidence that your end customer will be able to handle a higher price.

Overorder critical parts

Over the past year, many businesses have lost billions of dollars in market value because they didn’t order enough semiconductors. As the owner of a hardware company, you will encounter similar risks.

The supply for certain components, like computer chips, can be limited, and shortages can arise quickly if demand increases or supply chains get disrupted. It’s your job to analyze potential choke points in your supply chain and create redundancies around them."

How Amazon EC2 grew from a notion into a foundational element of cloud computing

In August 2006, AWS activated its EC2 cloud-based virtual computer, a milestone in the cloud infrastructure giant’s development.

“You really can’t overstate what Amazon was able to accomplish,” writes enterprise reporter Ron Miller.

In the 15 years since, EC2 has enabled clients of any size to test and run their own applications on AWS’ virtual machines.

To learn more about a fundamental technological shift that “would help fuel a whole generation of startups,” Ron interviewed EC2 VP Dave Brown, who built and led the Amazon EC2 Frontend team.

3 ways to become a better manager in the work-from-home era

Most managers agree that OKRs foster transparency and accountability, but running a team effectively has different challenges when workers are attending all-hands meetings from their kitchen tables.

Instead of just discussing key metrics before board meetings or performance reviews, make them part of the day-to-day culture, recommends Jeremy Epstein, Gtmhub’s CMO.

“Strengthen your team by creating authentic workplace transparency using numbers as a universal language and providing meaning behind your team’s work.”

The pre-pitch: 7 ways to build relationships with VCs

Many founders must overcome a few emotional hurdles before they’re comfortable pitching a potential investor face-to-face.

To alleviate that pressure, Unicorn Capital founder Evan Fisher recommends that entrepreneurs use pre-pitch meetings to build and strengthen relationships before asking for a check:

“This is the ‘we actually aren’t looking for money; we just want to be friends for now’ pitch that gets you on an investor’s radar so that when it’s time to raise your next round, they’ll be far more likely to answer the phone because they actually know who you are.”

Pre-pitches are good for more than curing the jitters: These conversations help founders get a better sense of how VCs think and sometimes lead to serendipitous outcomes.

“Investors are opportunists by necessity,” says Fisher, “so if they like the cut of your business’s jib, you never know — the FOMO might start kicking hard.”

Lessons from COVID: Flexible funding is a must for alternative lenders

FischerJordan’s Deeba Goyal and Archita Bhandari break down the pandemic’s impact on alternative lenders, specifically what they had to do to survive the crisis, taking a look at smaller lenders including Credibly, Kabbage, Kapitus and BlueVine.

“Only those who were able to find a way through the complexities of their existing capital sources were able to maintain their performance, and the rest were left to perish or find new funding avenues,” they write.

Inside Freshworks’ IPO filing

Customer engagement software company Freshworks’ S-1 filing depicts a company that’s experiencing accelerating revenue growth, “a great sign for the health of its business,” reports Alex Wilhelm in this morning’s The Exchange.

“Most companies see their growth rates decline as they scale, as larger denominators make growth in percentage terms more difficult.”

Studying the company’s SEC filing, he found that “Freshworks isn’t a company where we need to cut it lots of slack, as we might with an adjusted EBITDA number. It is going public ready for Big Kid metrics.”"

Sinovation founder Kai-Fu Lee and author of “Waste Tide” and others Chen Qiufan will join us at Disrupt (September 21-23) for a discussion of the fiction and fact of today’s hottest technology.

Lee, born in Taiwan, attended CMU and obtained a PhD in computer science, working initially on speech recognition before working for Apple, SGI and Microsoft, then establishing Google China as its president. His research and investment company, Sinovation (originally Innovation Works) has been his focus since its founding in 2009, and he has grown to become a leading mind and influential figure in AI.

When we last spoke with Lee, at Disrupt SF 2018, he emphasized that China was catching up to the U.S. on AI research, and had surpassed it in some ways. And certainly his own investments have contributed to that. Since then, as someone who thinks frequently about what the future holds, he has found a kindred spirit in Chen Qiufan.

Qiufan is a Chinese author whose 2013 novel “Waste Tide” propelled him to literary fame, though like many authors, that wasn’t enough to make him quit his day job until a few years later (Wired only just ran a profile on him). But by that time he had attracted the attention of Lee, who proposed a novel project: a collaborative book where the two would put their heads together to create a fictitious future informed by fact and realistic extrapolation.

The result is “AI 2041”: 10 stories by Qiufan set in the titular year, all over the world, with people from all walks of life encountering AI in the many ways that the authors speculate it may come to shape society over the next two decades. Each is followed by an explanatory essay by Lee that goes into the technical aspects and why they might lead to that future.

I’ll be posting a full review of the book ahead of the event, but I can certainly say that it’s unlike any collection I’ve read before. Each story is independent but takes place in something like a shared world, and each illustrates a potential application, conflict or change in thinking that AI could lead to. And, importantly, the AI is recognizable as descended directly from existing technologies.

For instance, one story concerns a talented deepfake creator working out of Lagos, one who knows the ins and outs of generative adversarial networks, image inspection, media pathways and so on. He’s tasked with creating a video of a long-dead celebrity that fools not just people watching it but the hosting service’s automated scanners, the government’s facial recognition algorithms and all the rest — but he begins to suspect there’s an unsavory motive behind it all (I won’t spoil the rest).

What follows the story is Lee’s essay on GANs, facial recognition and deepfakes that explains the concepts in an understandable but not patronizing way, then explores the risks and benefits in a non-narrative way. It helps ground the stories as real possibilities, not just imagined situations.

With both Qiufan and Lee onstage (virtually this time), the discussion of the book and the issues it brings up should be a lively one — not least because it will be moderated by yours truly.

The company is rolling out a new “TikTok Creator Marketplace API,” which allows marketing companies to integrate more directly with TikTok’s Creator Marketplace, the video app’s in-house influencer marketing platform.

On the Creator Marketplace website, launched in late 2019, marketers have been able to discover top TikTok personalities for their brand campaigns, then create and manage those campaigns and track their performance.

The new API, meanwhile, allows partnered marketing companies to access TikTok’s first-party data about audience demographics, growth trends, best-performing videos, and real-time campaign reporting (e.g. views, likes, shares, comments, engagement, etc.) for the first time.

They can then bring this data back into their own platforms, to augment the insights they’re already providing to their own customer base.

TikTok is not officially announcing the API until later in September, but it is allowing its alpha partners to discuss their early work.

One such partner is Capitv8, which tested the API with a NRF top 50 retailer on one of their first TikTok campaigns. The retailer wanted to discover a diverse and inclusive group of TikTok creators to partner with on a new collaboration and wanted help with launching its own TikTok channel. Captiv8 says the branded content received nearly 10 million views, and the campaign resulted in a “significant increase” in several key metrics, which performed about the Nielsen average. This included familiarity (+4% above average), affinity (+6%), purchase intent (+7%) and recommendation intent (+9%).

Capitv8 is now working with TikTok’s API to pull in audience demographics, to centralize influencer offers and activations, and to provide tools to boost branded content and monitor campaign performance. On that last front, the API allows the company to pull in real-time metrics from the TikTok Creator Marketplace API — which means Capitv8 is now one of only a handful of third-party companies with access to TikTok first-party data.

Another early alpha partner is Influential, who shared it’s also leveraging the API to access first-party insights on audience demographics, growth trends, best-performing videos, and more, to help its customer base of Fortune 1000 brands to identify the right creators for both native and paid advertising campaigns.

One partner it worked with was DoorDash, who launched multiple campaigns on TikTok with Influential’s help. It’s also planning to work with McDonald’s USA on several new campaigns that will run this year, including those focused on the chain’s new Crispy Chicken Sandwich and the return of Spicy McNuggets.

Other early alpha partners include Whalar and INCA. The latter’s integration stems from the larger TikTok global partnership with WPP, announced in February. That deal provided WPP agencies with early access to new advertising products marketing API integrations, and new AR offerings, among other things.

Creator marketplaces are now common to social media platforms with large influencer communities as this has become a standard way to advertise to online consumers, particular the younger generation. Facebook today offers its Brands Collabs Manager, for both Facebook and Instagram; YouTube has BrandConnect; while Snapchat recently announced a marketplace to connect brands with Lens creators. These type of in-house platforms make it easier for marketers to work with the wider influencer community by offering trusted data on metrics that matter to brands’ own ROI, rather than relying on self-reported data from influencers or on data they have to manually collect themselves. And as campaigns run, marketers can compare how well their partnered creators are able to drive results to inform their future collaborations.

TikTok isn’t making a formal announcement about its new API at this time, telling TechCrunch the technology is still in pilot testing phases for the time being.

“Creators are the lifeblood of our platform, and we’re constantly thinking of new ways to make it easy for them to connect and collaborate with brands. We’re thrilled to be integrating with an elite group of trusted partners to help brands discover and work with diverse creators who can share their message in an authentic way,” said Melissa Yang, TikTok’s Head of Ecosystem Partnerships, in a statement provided to select marketing company partners.

Update, 8/31/21, 3:22 PM ET: INCA is currently using the API in the U.S. and U.K. An earlier version said it was U.K. only, based on information provided by TikTok. We’ve since corrected."

It’s the 33rd Demo Day of the well-known accelerator and holds the largest cohort yet. YC S20 had 198 startups, so that’s a 90% increase from last year.

About half of the companies represented are based outside the U.S. The countries with the most representatives (aside from the U.S.) include India, with 33 startups; the U.K., with 18 startups; Mexico with 17; Singapore with 12; and Canada and Brazil, 11 each.

As a result, it is not surprising that this is the largest cohort from Africa,” Y Combinator managing director and group arptner Michael Seibel told TechCrunch when asked if any extra factor contributed to the rise in accepted African startups.

Another valid reason for the uptick could be that YC is getting more applications from Africa due to the recent success stories of Paystack and Flutterwave. At least, that’s the view shared by Kat Mañalac, the head of Outreach at YC.

“Alumni are always the best spokespeople and representatives for YC. A lot of African founders (and future founders) I’ve spoken to were encouraged by seeing Paystack do so well and get acquired.

Amenli, founded by Shady El Tohfa and Adham Nauman in 2020, is addressing an untapped $2 billion market, being the first licensed online insurance broker in the country.

Chari (Morocco)

A wave of disruption of digitizing informal retail stores is sweeping across emerging markets this year, and Chari is joining in on the action.

Sophia Alj and Ismael Belkhayat founded Chari in 2020. The company allows traditional retailers in Morocco and some parts of North Africa to order consumer goods via its platform and handles free delivery to their stores. Chari has a fintech side by providing these retailers with credit.

Fingo (Kenya)

Neobanks have taken the world by storm and Africa is the last frontier for this brand of fintech innovation. Fingo is providing an alternative brand of banking to African millennials, starting from Kenya.

Founded by Kiiru Muhoya Gitari Tirima James da Costa and Ian Njuguna in 2020, the digital bank claims to offer fees 90% cheaper than traditional banks in Kenya, among other services.

FloatPays (South Africa)

In South Africa, up to 5 million employees borrow money to meet their monthly needs when they exhaust their salaries. However, the lending options for these employees come with outrageous interest rates.

Simon Ward founded FloatPays in 2019 as an on-demand wage access platform to help employees access, spend, save and manage their money.

Freterium (Morocco)

Managers of delivery businesses handle hundreds or thousands of delivery points every day. With a fleet made up of many trucks or vans, there’s a need to drop a delivery plan for each at different locations daily. How do they optimize for costs and efficiency at the same time?

Enter Freterium. The company allows contractors, manufacturers, distributors and logisticians to plan and optimize their B2B or B2C shipments while providing a cloud platform for real-time visibility of shipments, logistics infrastructure and seamless collaboration that breaks down traditional organizational silos. Omar El Kouhene and Mehdi Cherif Alami founded Freterium in 2018.

Infiuss Health (Nigeria)

A large number of Africans are exempt from clinical research studies due to time constraints. Per reports, it can take up to ten months to conduct such studies in these climes.

Infiuss Health says it is building a decentralized platform for remote research and clinical trials in Africa. How? By connecting researchers directly to patients who want to participate in clinical research studies in less than a week.

The company was founded by Melissa Bime and Mbah Charles in 2020.

Lemonade Finance (Nigeria)

There are millions of African immigrants in Europe and North America. Some have established businesses in both these regions and also in Africa.

In another digital banking play, Lemonade Finance provides multi-currency accounts for these migrants to enable seamless transactions and banking. The company was founded by Rian Cochran and Ridwan Olalere in 2020

Mecho Autotech (Nigeria)

Repairing one’s vehicle can be a painstaking process in Africa due to pricing and quality issues. The latter is because many of these professionals (mechanics) are unvetted.

Ayoola Akinkunmi and Olusegun Owoade started Mecho Autotech in 2021 as an on-demand auto maintenance and repairs platform. Mecho Autotech has created a network of vetted mechanics, and via an app, car owners can book and pay for their services.

Odiggo (Egypt)

Like its predecessor on this list, Odiggo connects car owners with mobile mechanics in the Middle East. On the platform, car owners can also access extra services, which include car washing and maintenance.

Although Odiggo lists as a Dubai-based company on the YC database, it has origins in Egypt and launched operations first in the North African country.

Payhippo (Nigeria)

Access to credit is still very much a problem to the millions of small and medium businesses in Nigeria, which make up most of the country’s businesses.

Founded by Zach Bijesse, Uche Nnadi and Chioma Okotcha in 2019, Payhippo provides loans to businesses that couldn’t ordinarily get loans or credit cards from banks or other financial institutions.

Pylon (Egypt)

Water and electricity distribution companies face losses from leakages and thefts when opening new revenue streams in emerging markets.

Pylon acts as an infrastructure management platform for these distribution companies and helps to reduce these losses. It was founded in 2017 by Ahmed Ashour and Omar Radi.

ShipBlu (Egypt)

When merchants start to grow their e-commerce businesses, it can be difficult to manage the end-to-end delivery and fulfilment needs. In Egypt, several platforms are already offering solutions to this ever-growing need, and ShipBlu is adding to that list.

Founded by Ahmed ElKawass, Abdelrahman Hosny and Ali Nasser in 2020, ShipBlu claims to offer a full suite of delivery services for e-commerce merchants from overnight to delivery to five- to seven-day delivery.

Suplias (Nigeria)

Another digitizing-informal-retail-stores play, this time from Nigeria. Suplias is a B2B marketplace where mom-and -op stores in Africa buy inventory directly from manufacturers using a mobile app.

The company was founded by Stephen Igwue, Michael Adesanya and Sefa Ikyaator in 2019.

Union54 (Zambia)

African fintechs are in the business of providing virtual and physical cards to their customers. However, it doesn’t come easy and cheap when done in partnership with banks.

Union54 is an alternative and provides an API for them to issue debit cards cheaper and faster. It was founded by Alessandra Martini and Perseus Mlambo in 2021.

Yemaachi Biotechnology (Ghana)

Yaw Attua-Afari, Yaw Bediako, David Hutchful and Joyce Ngoi founded Yemaachi Biotechnology in 2020. The startup’s idea is to diversify precision cancer diagnostics and treatments across the continent, starting with Ghana.

An estimated 752,000 new cancer cases, 4% of the world’s total, occurred in sub-Saharan Africa in 2018. Yemaachi is working to lower the burden cancer causes by creating molecular diagnostics optimized for all Africans."

Its S-1 filing paints the picture of a company scaling rapidly, with improving profitability as it matures. However, to understand the company’s numbers, we’ll have to peel away certain costs for a clear picture.

The Exchange spoke with Freshworks CEO Girish Mathrubootham a few weeks ago about his company, a conversation that in hindsight we timed rather well. We’ll lean on notes from the call as we parse Mathrubootham’s IPO filing.

The Exchange explores startups, markets and money.

Read it every morning on Extra Crunch or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

Quite a lot of venture capital is riding on Freshworks’ IPO going well. The company raised hundreds of millions of dollars while private, per Crunchbase data, including a $150 million Series H in late 2019 that valued the company at around $3.5 billion. Its investor list includes Accel, Tiger, Sequoia and Capital G.

This morning, let’s dig into the company’s historical growth, track Freshworks’ changing profitability profile and check to see if its revenue quality is improving over time.

Quick notes on product

Before we dive into the numbers, let’s discuss Freshworks’ historical product work.

The company started life with a single piece of software called Freshdesk. Freshdesk was born after the company’s CEO struggled with poor customer service when trying to return a broken television.

Per Mathrubootham, he felt like there were more avenues than ever for customers to reach companies, and that the business market was evolving in a way that gave customers more clout in how brands were perceived. So, Freshdesk brought together a host of customer contact methods, including social media, which at the time was a more nascent market category.

Freshworks later noticed that some of its customers were using its customer service software to offer IT support to their own employees. From that observation, the company built Freshservice, a version of its original product, but tuned for internal use. The company later built out sales tools and, more recently, a unified database for customer data. The latter allows companies using Freshworks software to have a single record for each customer across marketing and sales interactions, which it intends to extend to support communications as well.

All that’s to say that Freshworks has a product that it can sell to small companies that may need a single piece of its larger product mix, and lots more software that it can upsell to those customers. And it has a product suite it can sell to larger companies as well.

So how has the company performed in the market? Let’s find out."

Specifically, Osana Salud is building an API-connected infrastructure to help the region’s healthcare industry offer a patient experience that offers “greater convenience, outcomes and value,” Lawson told TechCrunch.
The pandemic shed light on the fractures of the healthcare system in Latin America, Lawson believes.
“The healthcare infrastructure landscape in Latin America is highly fragmented,” he told TechCrunch.","Osana Salud, which aims to transform the healthcare infrastructure in Latin America, has closed on a $20 million Series A round of funding led by General Catalyst.

The Argentina-based, yet fully remote, startup was founded in 2019 — just a few months before the pandemic. Since launching less than a year ago, Osana says it has secured contracts with health insurance firms and providers that collectively serve more than 6 million patients in the region. For example, it is working with Sanatorio Güemes and PAMI, which has a network of 5 million patients, among others.

Quiet Capital, Preface Ventures, FJ Labs, AforeVC and K50 Ventures also put money in the latest round, which brings Osana’s total raised over its lifetime to $26.5 million. Lee Fixel’s Addition is also an investor.

CEO Andre Lawson told TechCrunch he was inspired to start Osana Salud because an estimated 50% of Latin America does not have access to quality healthcare. So he teamed up with COO Jorge Lopez to found the company to help change that. President Charu Sharma (the only staffer who is U.S.-based) and CTO Hugo Martin joined at a later date.

“Our vision is to enable affordable and accessible healthcare for every person in Latin America by leveraging technology,” Lawson said.

Specifically, Osana Salud is building an API-connected infrastructure to help the region’s healthcare industry offer a patient experience that offers “greater convenience, outcomes and value,” Lawson told TechCrunch. Its initial focus is on building solutions for telehealth, pharmacy and diagnostics.

For example, he said, Osana wants to make it faster and cheaper for healthcare players to build solutions that are “safe, secure and interact well” with other health systems. With that in mind, the company has tapped doctors and engineers to design that infrastructure.

“The goal is to empower the next generation of healthcare providers in building patient-centric solutions with the potential to positively impact the healthcare experiences and outcomes for hundreds of millions of people,” Lawson said.

In the past eight months, Osana has grown from four to about 50 people, and it expects to have over 250 employees in the next year. Despite not quite being two years old, the startup believes it’s already grown to be Latin America’s biggest telehealth company.

Sharma told TechCrunch that despite living in Silicon Valley, she was drawn to the company’s mission and found the potential to “massively transform healthcare for a whole continent” appealing.

“In the U.S. tech ecosystem, we focus on first-world problems a lot, but an emerging market like LatAm gave me the opportunity to make a meaningful impact at a very basic human need level,” she said. “As the saying goes, talent is equally distributed but opportunity is not.”

In fact, as evidence that remote work will never be the same after COVID, neither Sharma nor Martin have met Lawson or Lopez in person.

The new capital will in part go toward accelerating the company’s product roadmap, Lawson said, and helping it expand to Brazil and Mexico, where it has seen “strong inbound interest.” But primarily, it will be used for hiring.

The timing of the company’s inception was good. The pandemic shed light on the fractures of the healthcare system in Latin America, Lawson believes. It also gave the industry the opportunity to show the benefits of a “virtual first” approach, he added. And once people got a taste of it, they wanted more.

As a result, Osana says it has seen a big bump both in the number of clients and in the usage of its technology platform amongst existing ones.

“Furthermore, COVID-19 created urgency for healthcare providers, which resulted in very short sales cycles for us,” Lawson said.

Hemant Taneja of General Catalyst said the startup’s thesis aligns “perfectly” with his firm’s thesis around healthcare. Taneja himself is also a co-founder and executive chairman of San Francisco-based Commure, a venture-backed startup which is also building software infrastructure aimed at transforming the healthcare space.

“The healthcare infrastructure landscape in Latin America is highly fragmented,” he told TechCrunch. Most software vendors are small or medium-sized local vendors, who have not crossed into other Latin American geographies, Taneja pointed out.

“Osana has a variety of solutions for providers, payors and the pharmaceutical industry that are customizable and modular to create truly personalized experiences — regardless of the region in Latin America,” he said. “They can be an important unifier in a really fractured marketplace.”"

However, when the Costa Rican-born entrepreneur, now living in the Bay Area, saw how climate change was affecting coffee growers around the world — coffee is the fifth-most polluting crop in the value chain — she wanted to create a coffee product that tasted good, but was also sustainable.

“Temperatures are rising and combined with erratic rains are leading to lower crop yield,” Saenz told TechCrunch. “The same crop can’t grow in the same place anymore, or it will be a lower quality product. Farmers in Costa Rica are having to sell their land or go higher up the mountain. Experts predict that 50% of farmland will be unsuitable in the next couple of decades.”

Founded in 2020, Compound Foods uses synthetic biology to create coffee without coffee beans by extracting molecules. Saenz said the company spent a lot of time examining what makes coffee, well coffee, and then trying to correlate flavors and aromas in certain ways.

And yes, the company can still call it “coffee” even if it doesn’t contain coffee beans because there is no official regulatory definition, she said.

They use food science to recreate a base formula using sustainable ingredients that also don’t use a lot of water — she said it takes 140 liters of water along the coffee growth chain to make one cup of coffee. The company is also working toward a goal of being able to recreate coffee inspired by flavors that you would get from different areas of the world, like Costa Rica, but also the chocolate notes from a cup of Brazilian coffee.

Compound Foods announced $4.5 million in seed funding to give it total funding of $5.3 million to date. Backers of the company include Chris Sacca’s climate fund Lowercarbon Capital, SVLC, Humboldt Fund, Collaborative Fund, Maple VC, Petri Bio and angel investors like Nick Green, CEO of Thrive Market.

Saenz intends to use the new funding to improve the formulation and scale up the brand as the company works toward a soft launch by the end of the year.

There are a few competitors in the space doing different technology, including Seattle-based Atomo, which said it makes its coffee from “other fruits and plants that had seeds similar to coffee beans.”

Compound Foods is hiring coffee lovers to help build out its technology and to expand its marketing, product and business teams.

Saenz is clear that the company is not competing with coffee.

“We love coffee and know the farmers, and we are providing an alternative solution,” she added. “We want to recreate it, and even drink it on Mars one day, and we want to bring the coffee farmers and the industry with us on the journey.”"

The space industry uses LOX as an oxidizer in rocket propellant, often in combination with other gases like liquid hydrogen.
(That’s why there can be so much steam during a launch — it’s the hydrogen reacting with the oxygen to form water.)
ULA isn’t the only launch company to potentially be impacted by the LOX shortage.
“We’re actually going to be impacted this year with the lack of liquid oxygen for launch,” SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said last week during a panel at the Space Symposium.","The ongoing reverberations from the COVID-19 pandemic are continuing to make themselves felt in the most unlikely of places: spaceflight. On Friday, NASA took the unexpected step to ground a September satellite launch due to pandemic-related shortages of liquid oxygen (LOX), and there may be more launch delays yet to come.

Demand for oxygen has only risen with the Delta variant, which in many cities pushed hospitalization and ICU admittance rates back to where they were at the start of the pandemic. But oxygen isn’t just used in ventilators. The space industry uses LOX as an oxidizer in rocket propellant, often in combination with other gases like liquid hydrogen. (That’s why there can be so much steam during a launch — it’s the hydrogen reacting with the oxygen to form water.)

NASA and United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, said the launch date for the Landsat 9 satellite will now take place on September 23.

ULA isn’t the only launch company to potentially be impacted by the LOX shortage. “We’re actually going to be impacted this year with the lack of liquid oxygen for launch,” SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell said last week during a panel at the Space Symposium. “We certainly are going to make sure the hospitals are going to have the oxygen that they need, but for anybody who has liquid oxygen to spare, send me an email.”

Elon Musk, SpaceX’s founder and CEO, was more tempered a few days later on Twitter, saying that the LOX shortage “is a risk, but not yet a limiting factor.”

This is a risk, but not yet a limiting factor — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) August 26, 2021

Even beyond the actual supply of oxygen, the gas shortage is also being exacerbated by widespread shipping delays as coronavirus-related disruptions continue to impact the supply chain. ULA CEO Tory Bruno added on Twitter that a contractor who handles nitrogen transportation to Vandenberg Space Force Base in California was diverted to assist with LOX delivery in Florida.

The USG contractor that transports liquid GN2 to VAFB is helping with the COVID related LOX effort in Florida. Working that situation now. https://t.co/sTyprcRA42 — Tory Bruno (@torybruno) August 25, 2021

It’s not just the space industry that’s feeling the effects of the LOX squeeze: Shortly before NASA announced the launch delay, Orlando, Florida officials sent out a separate notice urging residents to conserve water, as LOX is used to treat the city’s water supply.

“Nationally, the demand for liquid oxygen is extremely high as the priority for its use is to save lives, which is limiting the supply that [Orlando municipal water utility] OUC is receiving,” Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said on Facebook. “There could be impacts to our water quality if we do not immediately reduce the amount of water we need to treat.”

As early as May of last year, the nonprofit Center for Global Development called COVID-19 a “wake-up call” for ensuring an adequate supply of oxygen to hospitals."

How to Raise Your First Dollars

Deciding how to go about getting your initial funding is always a tricky subject, as the wrong move could adversely impact your young company. In this session we’ll hear from Index Ventures’ Nina Achadjian, Sequoia Capital’s Luciana Lixandru and Canvas Ventures’ Rebecca Lynn — experts who’ve shepherded multiple companies from the earliest to the latest fundraises.

How to Ditch Traditional Fundraising

In 2021, venture capital has never been more plentiful, but some founders still can’t break into networks or have found that traditional fundraising isn’t the best route for their business. Fortunately, alternative fundraising techniques are gathering steam as founders find paths to raise cash that diverge from the startup success stories of the past. Join Pipe’s Harry Hurst, Accel’s Arun Mathew and Clearco’s Michele Romanow to learn more about alternative fundraising options.

You’ve Raised Your Seed Round — Now What? Preparing for Your Series A

You cleared the first hurdle: initial funding is in the bank. You’re hiring more talent, seeing the beginnings of a finished product with clear evidence of traction and experiencing the coveted growth that previously felt just out of reach. Before you know it, the decision to raise for what is arguably the most competitive round is staring you in the face. Join Samsung Next’s David Lee alongside founders Kadie Okwudili (Agapé), Andy Hoang (Aviron) and Jim Bugwadia (Nirmata) as they discuss the learnings and nuances of bridging seed to Series A. Presented by Samsung Next.

Where to Cut and Where to Spend in First-Check Fundraising

Every time a founder raises financing, they usually have one goal: growth. But what does that actually mean? And how do you begin divvying up your new capital between the various goals your startup is barreling toward? In this panel, which includes Harlem Capital’s Henri Pierre-Jacques, Equal Ventures’ Richard Kerby and BBG Ventures’ Nisha Dua, you will learn about how to spend your investment the best way, balancing runway with classic startup rigor.

How Circle’s $4.5B Public Listing Will Change Startup Fundraising

Circle acquired SeedInvest in 2019, as a further step toward realizing its vision of a more open, global, connected and inclusive financial system. Circle recently announced its plans to become a $4.5 billion public company with over $1 billion of fresh capital. In this session, Circle CEO and co-founder Jeremy Allaire and Ryan Feit, CEO and co-founder of SeedInvest, will break down the evolution of the two companies and how Circle and SeedInvest plan to double down on online fundraising to make it faster and easier for entrepreneurs.

Though this kind of federal support is critical in accelerating the mass adoption of EVs, we must face the impending need to rehabilitate the ailing U.S. electric infrastructure that millions currently rely on, namely the capabilities of the power grid.

As society converts to an all-electric future and demand rises for EVs, a challenge our modern world will face is how to charge the increasing number of vehicles without overstressing the grid past its capacity. While some predict EVs will overload the power grid, others have found methods that support our energy infrastructure, including solutions such as wireless charging, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) integration or more efficient methods of utilizing renewable energy sources, to name a few.

Amid warranted concerns about the unstable grid, there is an urgent need to find solutions that can reinforce this critical infrastructure to avoid pushing the grid to its limits.

The current challenges facing the grid

According to the recent IPCC climate change report, extreme heat waves that previously only struck once every 50 years are now expected to happen once per decade or more frequently due to global warming and anthropogenic emissions. While this has already been seen in this past year through record-breaking heat waves and extreme fires in the Pacific Northwest, utilities, operators and industry experts continue to express concern about whether current energy systems will be able to withstand increasing temperatures from climate change.

And it’s not just heat: In February, a cold snap in Texas crippled energy infrastructure and left millions without power. These numbers will only continue to increase as temperatures rise and the grid overworks itself to meet electricity needs.

In addition to fluctuating temperatures impacting the grid, many are also concerned about its ability to support the increasing number of EVs expected to hit the market in the coming years. With reports indicating that transportation electrification will likely require a doubling of U.S. generation capacity by 2050, there is a need for flexible EV charging options that can increase flexibility and load times during peak charging hours. However, as it currently stands, the U.S. power grid is only capable of supporting 24 million EVs until 2028 一 well under the required number of EVs needed to successfully curb road transport emissions.

Despite these challenges, one thing that industry experts have pointed out is that EVs have the potential to play a massive role in managing demand as well as aid in stabilizing the grid when necessary. However, as EVs are more widely adopted across the U.S., utilities need to ask themselves critical questions such as when people will likely charge their vehicles, how many users are charging their vehicles and when, what types of chargers are in use, and what types of vehicles are charging (such as passenger vehicles or medium- to heavy-duty fleets) to determine the additional demand for electricity and how they must upgrade their grids.

EV charging solutions will become an asset, not a liability

With long lead times for grid infrastructure upgrades paired with an increasing number of individuals and companies looking to electrify their vehicles, municipalities across the U.S. are desperately searching for methods to implement the necessary charging infrastructure to stay ahead of the rising EV tide while simultaneously ensuring the grid’s stability. However, a recent analysis by the ICCT estimates that with the current number of U.S. EV chargers at 216,000, the country will need 2.4 million public and workplace chargers by 2030 if it wants to meet its goals.

To address this concerning lack of charging infrastructure, cities have begun to explore charging options outside of the traditional, stationary station to not only speed up the adoption of the necessary charging infrastructure, but to protect the grid as well. One of these options is dynamic charging, otherwise known as wireless or in-motion charging.

On one hand, some argue wireless electric vehicle charging will pose an additional strain on existing grid infrastructure by increasing demand variability due to fragmented charging duration caused by charging lane layouts and traffic. On the other hand, many argue that wireless charging actually decreases the demand on the power grid due to the fact that energy demand is spread over time and space throughout the day, rather than being confined to stationary chargers’ charging period between 2 p.m. and 7 p.m., which enables a reduction in required grid connections and upgrades.

Additionally, wireless charging can be deployed in locations where conductive (plug-in) charging solutions cannot — such as roads, directly under commercial facility loading docks, at exit and entry points to facilities, under taxi queues, at bus stations and terminals, etc., which means that wireless technology can charge EVs at regular intervals throughout the day with “top-up” charging.

This method also enables more efficient utilization of renewable solar energy, produced and utilized predominantly during daylight hours, meaning limited additional energy storage devices are required, unlike conductive EV charging stations, which can typically only be used in the evening and nighttime hours and require energy storage.

These benefits indicate that cities and utilities alike can capitalize on efficient energy utilization strategies such as wireless charging to spread energy demand over time and space — adding additional flexibility and protection to the grid. While this method can and should be applied to passenger EVs, using it to power medium- to heavy-duty fleet vehicles will allow for a much faster transition to electric in these challenging-to-electrify fleet segments.

Can wireless charging assist the grid in supporting widespread adoption of EVs?

While passenger EVs pose challenges of their own to the grid, large-scale fleet charging will be a monumental task if utilities don’t get ahead of the transition. Wireless charging offers a cost-effective solution to operators looking to transition to meet carbon reduction goals, with projected numbers of electric commercial and passenger fleets making up 10%-15% of all fleet vehicles by 2030. Let’s take a closer look at an example comparison between plugging in large vehicles versus wireless charging and the impact both have on the grid:

Conductive (plug-in): 100 e-buses with 240 kWh batteries using overnight conductive charging at a bus depot requires a minimum grid connection of 6 megawatts (MW) because the entire fleet charges at the end of daily operations, typically simultaneously.

100 e-buses with 240 kWh batteries using overnight conductive charging at a bus depot requires a minimum grid connection of 6 megawatts (MW) because the entire fleet charges at the end of daily operations, typically simultaneously. Inductive (wireless): 100 e-buses using wireless charging stationary charging technology at bus terminals, garages and stations located inside city centers enable the buses to be “topped-up” throughout the day at natural breaks in their operations. This charging strategy enables both massive battery capacity reduction (the exact amount depends on the fleet and vehicle energy requirements) and, because the bus fleet charging is spread throughout the day, the required grid connection(s) can be reduced by 66% to just 2 MW.

Wireless electric roads accompanied by solar panel fences adjacent to the road may be the ultimate solution for decentralizing power generation and eliminating stress on the grid. According to industry calculations, approximately 0.6 miles of this electric fence solution could provide between 1.3-3.3 MW of power. This combination of solar generation coupled with wireless charging infrastructure embedded into the road can support anywhere between 1,300 to 3,300 buses per day independent of power grid supply (assuming an average speed of 50 mph and accounting for seasonal variations in solar radiation).

Furthermore, because wireless electric roads are a shared platform for all EVs, this same road would also charge trucks, vans and passenger vehicles without placing additional pressures on the grid.

Innovative charging methods will play a critical role in modernizing and adapting our power grid

Although wireless charging is still relatively new to the market, the benefits are beginning to become glaringly self-evident. Amid increasing concerns about outdated grid infrastructure in the face of widespread transport electrification efforts, rising temperatures and extreme weather conditions, innovative charging methods can provide an optimal solution.

From distributing EV charging throughout the day to avoid overloads to being able to support the energy capacity needs of both passenger vehicles and large fleets simultaneously, technologies such as wireless charging will become critical resources in adapting to an all-electric decarbonized future."

Today, though, doses have been delivered to almost 40% of the world’s people—and some are being asked to prove they’re among them, leading to the rise of so-called vaccine passports. The details of these credentials vary from place to place, but at their heart they are the same: digital health records, stored on your phone, to use as proof that you are a low risk to others.

Supporters of digital vaccination credentials say the benefits are clear: they make congregating less risky while incentivizing vaccination. But critics see drawbacks and disadvantages. They say introducing restrictions infringes on civil liberties, unfairly punishes those who cannot get vaccinated (and discriminates against those who will not), unleashes another form of surveillance, and worsens inequalities rather than eradicating them.

Faced with this divergence of views, governments are taking very different approaches. In Europe, for example, seven countries launched a “digital green certificate” at the beginning of June, with another 21 nations due to join shortly. But some places are taking the opposite stance, strictly limiting the use of such documents or even banning their development altogether.

Along with these debates, there is still basic confusion about how systems would be used. Some, like the EU’s app, are for traveling between nations. Others, like New York State’s, are for getting into everyday places like restaurants and events. The term “passport” itself is becoming more ambiguous and more politically loaded: when California governor Gavin Newsom announced the launch of his state’s digital certificate, he specifically stated, “It’s not a passport; it’s not a requirement.”

We looked at the status of digital vaccine systems in all 50 states

President Joe Biden has already said there won’t be a national app, leaving the choice to states. Some states have banned the apps outright as examples of government overreach. Often the debate over the technology seems like a proxy for a larger question: Should governments and businesses be allowed to require vaccination for covid?

A few key takeaways:

Most states have addressed the technology in some way, either in legislation or in comments from a lawmaker, a public health official, or the governor.

7 states have active vaccine certification apps, rising from 4 at our last count.

22 states have banned the systems to some degree, typically through executive orders. Most, though not all, of these states are Republican-led.

Each state is listed on the map according to the current legal status of vaccine apps at the time of publication. ""Active"" indicates that a state has created and released a digital system for showing that you have been vaccinated against covid. It does not mean that presenting vaccination credentials is mandatory state-wide, although there may be such requirements on a local level.

This lack of clarity—and sometimes the conflict—in public health messages can filter down to the press and create a vacuum where misleading or unverified information can fester and spread, DiResta says.

Scientists are often looking for answers at the same time the public is, but that’s not always clear to ordinary people, who may expect immediate and authoritative information.

“One of the things [public health authorities] weren’t necessarily doing that we need to see moving forward is actually communicating about the uncertainty,” says Renée DiResta, technical research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory.

This lack of clarity—and sometimes the conflict—in public health messages can filter down to the press and create a vacuum where misleading or unverified information can fester and spread, DiResta says.

“That void can be filled by anyone with an opinion,” she adds.

All those conflicting messages, combined with the reality of slow scientific timelines, can exacerbate distrust. Instead of seeing changes in official guidance as signs that health authorities are responding to new data responsibly, it‘s easy for the public to believe that those authorities and the media had it wrong again—for example, when the CDC changed its mask guidelines. Politically motivated actors exploit that distrust. Sloppy headlines and misleading tweets by reputable news outlets, or journalists’ predictions that age poorly, can be repurposed into ”gotcha” memes that hyperpartisan influencers use to continue chipping away at trust in the media.

“Entities like Newsmax will take any opportunity to find a misreported or changed fact from a CNN broadcast,” DiResta says.

Public health officials (and the reporters covering what officials say and do) need a better system of communicating what we don’t yet know and explaining that guidance could change on the basis of new information. DiResta has argued for a Wikipedia-like approach to public health, where the evolution of scientific knowledge and debate is public and transparent, and a wide range of experts can contribute what they know. “It is never going to go back to the old way, where they make some determination in some back room and present a unified consensus to a trusting public,” she says. “That model is over.”

""If journalists spent less time on this day-to-day, blow-by-blow, and more time developing these complex and nuanced stories, we will be doing a much greater public service."" Erika Check Hayden, UC Santa Cruz

We already see that kind of scientific back-and-forth play out on social media between researchers, public health experts, and doctors. Erika Check Hayden, a science journalist and director of the science communication program at the University of California, Santa Cruz, says that journalists need to remember to do their due diligence with this increased access to scientific deliberation.

“It can be informative, from a journalist’s perspective, if you understand [how experts] are working out what is going on,” she says. “What’s unhelpful is if you latch on to that at any given moment and portray it as some sort of conclusion.”

That’s good advice for the average reader, too.

Focus on what’s most useful

So how can you find trustworthy news that feels relevant to your life? One option is to keep an eye out for sources, especially local ones, that don’t exclusively focus on blow-by-blow coverage. Reporting that contextualizes the daily numbers you see is likely more helpful than an endless series of stories that simply rattle off the top-line data.

South Side Weekly—a nonprofit newspaper based in Chicago—offers a model for something different. The Weekly covers the South Side of Chicago, a majority nonwhite area. The largely volunteer newspaper produced the ChiVaxBot, an automated Twitter account that shares two maps side by side each day: covid-19 vaccination rates by zip code and covid-19 death rates by zip code. Instead of showing a snapshot of the data on one day, the daily updates demonstrated a pattern over time. Because of this consistent, slow tracking, the bot sounded the alarm on vaccine disparities: Black and Latino areas showed high deaths but low rates of vaccinations, a situation that continues to this day."

Even if APPS and other databases had not yet achieved the level of function they were intended to, they still contain many terabytes of data on Afghan citizens that the Taliban can mine.
Ultimately, some experts say the fact that Afghan government databases were not very interoperable may actually be a saving grace if the Taliban do try to use the data.
But for those connected to the APPS database, who may now find themselves or their family members hunted by the Taliban, it’s less irony and more betrayal.","According to Jacobsen’s book, AABIS aimed to cover 80% of the Afghan population by 2012, or roughly 25 million people. While there is no publicly available information on just how many records this database now contains, and neither the contractor managing the database nor officials from the US Defense Department have responded to requests for comment, one unconfirmed figure from the LinkedIn profile of its US-based program manager puts it at 8.1 million records.

AABIS was widely used in a variety of ways by the previous Afghan government. Applications for government jobs and roles at most projects required a biometric check from the MOI system to ensure that applicants had no criminal or terrorist background. Biometric checks were also required for passport, national ID, and driver’s license applications, as well as registrations for the country’s college entrance exam.

Another database, slightly smaller than AABIS, was connected to the “e-tazkira,” the country’s electronic national ID card. By the time the government fell, it had roughly 6.2 million applications in process, according to the National Statistics and Information Authority, though it is unclear how many applicants had already submitted biometric data.

Biometrics were also used—or at least publicized—by other government departments as well. The Independent Election Commission used biometric scanners in an attempt to prevent voter fraud during the 2019 parliamentary elections, with questionable results. In 2020, the Ministry of Commerce and Industries announced that it would collect biometrics from those who were registering new businesses.

Despite the plethora of systems, they were never fully connected to each other. An August 2019 audit by the US found that despite the $38 million spent to date, APPS had not met many of its aims: biometrics still weren’t integrated directly into its personnel files, but were just linked by the unique biometric number. Nor did the system connect directly to other Afghan government computer systems, like that of the Ministry of Finance, which sent out the salaries. APPS also still relied on manual data-entry processes, said the audit, which allowed room for human error or manipulation.

A global issue

Afghanistan is not the only country to embrace biometrics. Many countries are concerned about so-called “ghost beneficiaries”—fake identities that are used to illegally collect salaries or other funds. Preventing such fraud is a common justification for biometric systems, says Amba Kak, the director of global policy and programs at the AI Now institute and a legal expert on biometric systems.

“It’s really easy to paint this [APPS] as exceptional,” says Kak, who co-edited a book on global biometric policies. It “seems to have a lot of continuity with global experiences” around biometrics.

""Biometric ID as the only efficient means for legal identification is … flawed and a little dangerous."" Amber Kak, AI Now

It’s widely recognized that having legal identification documents is a right, but “conflating biometric ID as the only efficient means for legal identification,” she says, is “flawed and a little dangerous.”

Kak questions whether biometrics—rather than policy fixes—are the right solution to fraud, and adds that they are often “not evidence-based.”

But driven largely by US military objectives and international funding, Afghanistan’s rollout of such technologies has been aggressive. Even if APPS and other databases had not yet achieved the level of function they were intended to, they still contain many terabytes of data on Afghan citizens that the Taliban can mine.

“Identity dominance”—but by whom?

The growing alarm over the biometric devices and databases left behind, and the reams of other data about ordinary life in Afghanistan, has not stopped the collection of people’s sensitive data in the two weeks between the Taliban’s entry into Kabul and the official withdrawal of American forces.

This time, the data is being collected mostly by well-intentioned volunteers in unsecured Google forms and spreadsheets, highlighting either that the lessons on data security have not yet been learned—or that they must be relearned by every group involved.

Singh says the issue of what happens to data during conflicts or governmental collapse needs to be given more attention. “We don't take it seriously,” he says, “But we should, especially in these war-torn areas where information can be used to create a lot of havoc.”

Kak, the biometrics law researcher, suggests that perhaps the best way to protect sensitive data would be if “these kinds of [data] infrastructures ... weren’t built in the first place.”

For Jacobsen, the author and journalist, it is ironic that the Department of Defense’s obsession with using data to establish identity might actually help the Taliban achieve its own version of identity dominance. “That would be the fear of what the Taliban is doing,” she says.

Ultimately, some experts say the fact that Afghan government databases were not very interoperable may actually be a saving grace if the Taliban do try to use the data. “I suspect that the APPS still doesn’t work that well, which is probably a good thing in light of recent events,” said Dan Grazier, a veteran who works at watchdog group the Project on Government Oversight, by email.

But for those connected to the APPS database, who may now find themselves or their family members hunted by the Taliban, it’s less irony and more betrayal.

“The Afghan military trusted their international partners, including and led by the US, to build a system like this,” says one of the individuals familiar with the system. “And now that database is going to be used as the [new] government’s weapon.”

To protect the real ACE2 receptors, here’s how the decoy does its job:

Usually, spike proteins on the virus’s surface act like keys to ACE2 receptors, opening up the doorway to infection. But the decoys, administered intravenously or through the nose depending on the stage of the disease, intercept the spike protein, leading it away from real receptors. After infection, the treatment could reduce the viral load inside the body, which might mean faster recovery times for patients.

In one study led by Daniel Batlle, a professor of medicine at Northwestern University, mice that were infected with the disease and got the treatment had only mild symptoms compared with animals that went untreated, which died.

As of today, only one clinical trial of the ACE2 product has been completed in patients with moderate to severe symptoms. Even so, more and more researchers are supporting the new therapeutic.

Batlle’s team began working on decoy proteins in January 2020 after learning about the first US case, building on knowledge gleaned from China’s 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak.

“We knew that it would be very likely that the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 would be ACE2, since it had been previously shown to be the case for SARS-CoV,” Batlle says.

But applying that knowledge wasn’t so straightforward. Michael Jewett, a professor of chemical engineering at Northwestern University who was not involved in the study, compares the intricate process of making a decoy to an especially fiendish puzzle."

It is part of a wave of companies overhauling the way digital content is produced. And it has big implications for the human workforce.

Liri does her waitressing and bar work in person, but she has little idea what her digital clones are up to. “It is definitely a bit strange to think that my face can appear in videos or ads for different companies,” she says.

Hour One is not the only company taking deepfake tech mainstream, using it to produce mash-ups of real footage and AI-generated video. Some have used professional actors to add life to deepfaked personas. But Hour One doesn’t ask for any particular skills. You just need to be willing to hand over the rights to your face.

Character driven

Hour One is building up a pool of what it calls “characters.” It says it has around 100 on its books so far, with more being added each week. “We’ve got a queue of people that are dying to become these characters,” says Natalie Monbiot, the company’s head of strategy.

Anyone can apply to become a character. Like a modeling agency, Hour One filters through applicants, selecting those it wants on its books. The company is aiming for a broad sample of characters that reflect the ages, genders, and racial backgrounds of people in the real world, says Monbiot. (Currently, around 80% of its characters are under 50 years old, 70% are female, and 25% are white.)

To create a character, Hour One uses a high-resolution 4K camera to film a person talking and making different facial expressions in front of a green screen. And that’s it for the human part of the performance. Plugging the resulting data into AI software that works in a similar way to deepfake tech, Hour One can generate an endless amount of footage of that person saying whatever it wants, in any language.

The AI character that Hour One created using Liri's face

Hour One’s clients pay the company to use its characters in promotional or commercial video. They select a face, upload the text they want it to say, and get back a video of what looks like a real person delivering that script to a camera. The quickest service uses text-to-speech software to generate synthetic voices, which are synced with the characters’ mouth movements and facial expressions. Hour One also offers a premium service where the audio is recorded by professional voice actors. These voices are again fitted to the movements of the character in the video. Hour One says it has more than 40 clients, including real estate, e-commerce, digital health, and entertainment firms. One major client is Berlitz, an international language school that provides teacher-led video courses for dozens of languages.

According to Monbiot, Berlitz wanted to increase the number of videos it offered but struggled to do so using real human actors. They had to have production crews creating the same setup with the same actor over and over again, she says: “They found it really unsustainable. We’re talking about thousands of videos.”

Berlitz now works with Hour One to generate hundreds of videos in minutes. “We’re replacing the studio,” says Monbiot. “A human being doesn’t need to waste their time filming.”"

“They’re making the regime’s crimes transparent,” says Andrei Sannikov, a former Belarusian diplomat who is not part of either the Cyber Partisans or BYPOL.

“The Cyber Partisans wrote to us to help them find a way to understand all the law enforcement and intelligence agencies,” he says.

According to interviews, the hackers benefit from a partnership with a key group of Belarusian law enforcement and intelligence officers.

A group called BYPOL, which includes current and former regime officials, has been offering close guidance for many months. Some of them are providing help from outside the country, having defected after Lukashenko’s fraudulent claims of victory in the 2020 presidential election and the brutal crackdown that followed. But others, the group says, are working against Lukashenko from within in the conviction that his regime—which arrested more than 27,000 people in the wake of protests last year—must fall.

“They’re making the regime’s crimes transparent,” says Andrei Sannikov, a former Belarusian diplomat who is not part of either the Cyber Partisans or BYPOL. “The information they’re getting by hacking the state really is very eloquent in witnessing the criminal activities of the regime against the citizens.”

“I saw falsifications with my own eyes”

While Belarus has been under Lukashenko’s control for almost 30 years, protests and opposition have ramped up significantly since the elections held in August 2020. His disputed victory led to a swell of anti-regime protests as Lukashenko violently crushed peaceful dissent.

The crackdowns were a breaking point for many. Aliaksandr Azarau was a lieutenant colonel in Belarus’s police force, and before that, he worked to combat organized crime and corruption for the Ministry of Interior. He says what he saw turned him against the regime.

“I was present at the election,” Azarau says. “I saw falsifications with my own eyes. I decided to resign after I received unlawful orders from superior officers. A lot of people were detained in the first days after the election. My colleagues were illegally sending false documents about crimes these people committed. I decided Lukashenko kept his power illegally.”

He was one of a significant number of law enforcement officials who left Belarus as a result. About a dozen of them reconvened in Warsaw, in neighboring Poland, and launched BYPOL in October. (The group’s name means Belarus Police.) They say they have hundreds of members and contacts still inside government security agencies including the secret police (known as the KGB), the Ministry of Interior, and border control.

""They wanted to know how to penetrate inside these organizations to steal information. Because we work there, we know everything inside.""

The Cyber Partisans say they are made up of around 15 IT experts from Belarus’s technology sector: the country has a thriving scene, including numerous gaming and social startups, although many experts have left in opposition to the regime.

They began defacing government websites in September 2020, a simple but highly visible act of protest that got them attention as the country convulsed in turmoil.

In December of that year, according to Azarau, the Partisans reached out to BYPOL with bigger goals in mind.

“The Cyber Partisans wrote to us to help them find a way to understand all the law enforcement and intelligence agencies,” he says. “They wanted to know how to penetrate inside these organizations to steal information. Because we work there, we know everything inside. We consulted with them on how to do this.”

After those early discussions, the Cyber Partisans say they ended up carrying out the actual hacks themselves. BYPOL’s current and former security force members have helped them understand the structure of government databases, process the data they access, and identify individuals from hacked phone calls. Insiders are also able to “provide feedback from within the system on how the hack affected the security forces,” the hacking group’s spokesperson says."

Baird thinks one especially intriguing application for lucid dreaming might be in art. “One technique from the visual artists I’ve met is that they find an ‘art gallery’ in their lucid dream and look at the painting hanging in the gallery,” he says. “They then wake up and paint what they saw.

A small but growing number of scientists led by Baird and other sleep labs around the world hope to learn more about how lucid dreaming works, how it’s triggered, and whether the average person can be taught how to do it regularly. By studying individuals who are able to recall what happened to them in their dreams, these researchers can correlate what cognitive processes are occurring in the mind while brain and physiological activity is being measured and observed. For example, how does the brain perceive specific objects or physical tasks taking place solely in the mind? How does it respond to visuals that aren’t really there? How does it emulate parts of consciousness without actually being fully conscious?

Some researchers, like Martin Dresler, a cognitive neuroscientist at Radboud University in the Netherlands, suggest lucid dreaming could even be used to combat clinical disorders like recurring nightmares or PTSD. “I think it’s quite intuitive and plausible that if during a nightmare you realize that it’s not real, that obviously takes much of the sort of sting out of the nightmare,” he says. You may be able to simply train yourself to wake up and end the dream, or overcome the very vivid feelings of fear and fright by telling yourself that it’s a dream."

From “Pharmacology and the Brain”: Since ancient times, drugs have been used to restore mental health or explore the mind. It was said that the Homeric physician Polydama presented Menelaos and Helen with “a drug against sorrow and anger, a drug to survive despair” on their way home to Troy. The number of mind-bending drugs available today is countless. Some have altered the course of medical practice; others have changed the fabric of our society. Many have greater specificity of action and fewer side effects than ever before. The development of such drugs has been paralleled by our increased knowledge of how drugs work on the molecular level to modify behavior. In this regard, one of the most fruitful research approaches has involved the study of how nerve cells communicate with other cells in the body, and how various drugs might alter this communication.

May / June 1987

From “Designing Computers That Think the Way We Do”: Neuroscientists have come to realize that the architecture of the brain is central to its function. Individual neurons aren’t smart by themselves, but when they’re connected to each other they become quite intelligent. The problem is, nobody knows how they do it. It isn’t that neurons are fast: in sending their electrochemical messages to other neurons, they are 100,000 times slower than a typical computer switch. But what our brains lack in speed they make up in“wetware,” as it is sometimes called. The brain contains from 10 billion to a trillion neurons, each of which may be connected to anywhere from 1,000 to 100,000 others. If this vast net of interconnected neurons forms the grand collective conspiracy we call our minds, maybe a vast interconnected net of mechanical switches can make a machine that thinks.
